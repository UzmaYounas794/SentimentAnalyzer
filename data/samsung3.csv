"They must have include the charger which is very disappointing. Display is ok but amoled Displays are sometimes that samsung is famous for & not getting it in the phone is sad, at least they should give IPS or LCD Display. Selfie camera is only 8 pm which performs poor in night, Which should be at least 12 or 16 pm. Not an camera phone I must say. Except this other things are good. A phone for decent performance and for minimum user personality.READ MORE",0

Purchased this phone few weeks ago Phone was brilliant and I got the 6gb 128gb variant @14999 only and a 25w travel adaptor @299Camera quality is excellent and the snapdragon 750g process at this price segment is amazing one. Battery backup is very goodThe virtual ram of 6gb is too greatIt comes with ips Display and that is the only thing which needs to be improved coz samsung's m series m21 which comes @12999 has SAMOLED display. That is the only minor disadvantageREAD MORE,1

I tried connecting 200mbps wifi but this phone doesn't connect it satable. The phone internet speed reduced to 200mbps to 20mbps after few minutes. Same wifi network i tried with redmi note phone and lenovo laptop the speed was good 200mbps was stable in those devices. Most of the users who bought so far not aware of this issue because they can realize it only if they have 200mbps connection. We are buying 5g for network speed samsung should mind it. They should've tested it many times.READ MORE,0
