"First of all battery is awesome, display wonderful overall fine. Drawback of  phone - camera is very poor, charger is of c type so no other charger can be used for charging, hybrid slot  so u cannot use 2 sim and 1 sd card  at same time.

I used the phone continuously on moderate level for 2 days and still the battery left was around 20 percent.2.

Great mobile in this price bracket. I accidentally broken my last phone and in a hurry to get the phone but did not have money to buy a featured rich phone. So decided to go with budget phone for the time. But this phone amazed me with its quality. As it has loud volume so good to hear songs on the phone and it has 5000 mah battery which gives you backup for the day easily only flaws is 10 watt charger for many user to charge such a large battery. But for me it's not an issue. Love this phone...READ MORE,1
