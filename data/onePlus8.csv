Reviews,Verdict
I was skeptical at first. Now I see iphone pays influencers to enter their stupid opinions ... OnePlus nord 200 5g is an awesome buy! Works great on at&t ...,0
"Very unimpressed with this phone. I had to replace my one-year-old Redmi Note 9 Pro phone because of the 5G transition required by the ISPs.  I LOVED the Redmi. I do not love--or even like a lot--the Nord OnePlus.The screen is dark:  to bring the light up to the level needed to illuminate the data/apps, particularly when using it outside, it drains the battery rather quickly.The quick app menu icons (e.g., to take screenshots) are ridiculously large, very asthetically DISpleasing. There is no way to make them smaller other than installing a brand-new app loader.The camera app they had preinstalled was demanding I give it access to contacts, phone numbers, etc. No, thank you!  I replaced the app with another one from GooglePlay, which, btw, is superior in its photo features and quality.Constant nagging from Nord to ""finish setting up"" the phone--which actually means insisting I join their ""community"".  No, Thank you!Slow charging. Not the super-fast speed they claim.",0
"I’m an iPhone user who bought this phone as a backup. I love the design the battery life and the user interface. It has a 90hz display by the cpu is the bottleneck and it’s more janky than my old iPhone X. The camera is also bad, despite there are 3 of them…..But I would really like to give the higher end one plus a try!",1
Excellent value,0
"Su audio esta bastante bien , es un poco sensible al tacto . La cámara está bien no es la más guapo pero bien. El teléfono hará ahora va bien . Lo que me asusto un poco fue que la batería se le calentó mucho una vez así de la nada y como no se le puede sacar la batería pues lo tu e que apagar .pero no lo a vuelto a hacer hasta ahora . El celular es good",0
I bought two of these phones. The first one wouldn't  charge. The second  one turned  the RTT on and it won't go off. One plus is having  issues  with the RTT. They need to keep these out of America. They certainly  didn't do us a favor selling them here. Then to top it off Amazon customer service lied and told me the money  would  go to a gift card I couldn't  see it in my account. I have to get the phone  back from UPS. I would recommend not purchasing  a phone fom Amazon at all. The customer  service  agents don't UNDERSTAND ENGLISH!!!,0
Great product... Battery Life needs improvement,0
I am a OnePlus fan for life I got there first flagship phone about 10 years ago and fell in love recently I've purchased the OnePlus N10... Had that phone for about 3 years and then I dropped it had to get another phone... Went back to Samsung got an S9... Didn't have that too long because I got another one plus I just can't leave these phone operation alone they're the simple version of Android but yet their phones work so fast and adapt so quickly. There's not anything you can't find on the internet to help you with your OnePlus this phone gives me no issues,0
"Facial recognition is a great feature, bluetooth connectivity to auto radio works well.",1
I go,0
Nice,0
Phone itself is decent for the price you pay. The front selfie camera is the absolute worst. Over exposure and too bright which seems to be the software. However oneplus does not consider this a bug yet despite all the complaints in their forums about this issue. So a fix is unlikely. Unfortunately will return this since primary need is for video calls and the front camera performs worse than a 100$ phone.,1
"It's pretty big. I don't use facial recognition because there's really no need for it and it's stupid anyway. Fingerprint sensor is pretty good. The camera leaves a lot to be desired especially if your coming off of an iphone but I knew that going in. I wanted to get a Google phone but too expensive. So I settled on this. It's pretty good, charges quickly. And it looks really nice just out of the box. I was tired of Samsung budget series wannabe S series. The last two I had were glitchy as hell. And Unless you wanna spend at least 300 on a better model Motorola I feel like they are right in the same category as the those Samsung phones. The last one I had was really crappy. So if don't wanna spend hundreds on a new ugly 49 camera lenses iPhone and your sick of Samsung and Motorola, I'd  say go ahead and get this. There are better phones probably. But not many as fast as this one for the same amount of money. Overall I'm happy with the purchase after having had it for a couple of months.",0
I got two of these for my kids and they love them. Full featured device for less than half the cost of bigger named brands. Great deal for all but the biggest power users. I am seriously thinking of leaving the Samsung Galaxy lineup for my next upgrade and moving to this much more reasonably priced lineup.,0
Been with Verizon for a very long time. Mostly used Qualcomm or Samsung phones. Nothing else compares to this new OnePlus battery life. Excellent life span & very quick Charging!,1
Good Case,1
"usually i don't write reviews, and i am not a phone person so this should be taken with a grain of salt.  I hate phones, and i believe smart phones are the worst invention because trying to get a phone to do a computers job is like asking a carriage to be faster than a car.  it doesn't make sense to me in any way shape or form.  however, this phone has blew my expectations.  I am speaking from a personal point as a person who thinks having a phone is a hassle(charging, and then making sure its set to networks, etc).  This phone surpasses my wildest expectations, and is a true 5G phone.  i don't take pictures much, but i will say for my use it does a good job.  The battery life is really long on this phone. I can usually go 2 days without charging(provided i don't use the pis suhone as much).  The connection  is superb and i am very happy",0
"My prior phone, a Google Pixel 3, had been entering an infinite boot loop due to an overly sensitive power button, so I thought I would give the OnePlus brand a try. The Nord 200 fell nicely into my desired price range, and although it wasn't important to me, it also had 5G.I generally have found that when going from a 3+ year old phone to newer one, the performance has increased. Not so with the Nord 200 (released in June 2021). On paper, the specs seemed to lean in favor of the OnePlus, if slightly. However, after unboxing and installing my software, I found the UI to be sluggish at the best of times. It's downright frustrating at others.Bottom line: I didn't do my homework, and I didn't realize how spoiled I was with the Pixel 3. As a budget phone, this is probably good enough, but I feel if I had spent another $60 on the OnePlus N10, I would have been happier. PC Mag feels this is one of the best low-budget phone on the market. Maybe. I have a couple days to decide if I'm keeping it or returning it; I haven't decided.My Geekbench results: Single-core 481, Multi-core 1271.",0
"Perfect budget phone. Do not expect flagship features. I use iPhone 12 Pro Max and got this to have a second device as I need Android for work.Unlocking the screen is not the fastest. Face recognition doesn't work with glasses on, fingerprint is located on the side button(power button) I found it tricky cause i wake up the screen with double tap. Fingerprint reader works however not the best. Camera also is not satisfying, especially at night. But remember this is budget phone, and for this price i think it is pretty good deal. I will keep it.",0
"I have been using this phone for about 2 months.  I have to say that compared to flagship Samsung models, this phone is pretty bulky/heavy, There is a lag when using the phone (switching between apps, or even typing things), which I'm guessing has to do with the processor.The fingerprint unlock and battery life though, is excellent.I used to have a galaxy S9 before this phone, which I'm considering on going back to.",1
Slow. Slow and slower.  This phone is much slower than my 7+ when it was out of storage even.  It's was hell activating with ATT.  I was told it will not work come Feb. even though it is listed as one that will. That's all on Att.  I'm a OnePlus fan. I would never recommend this device to anyone.,1
"Bonito, rápido, saca buenas imágenes, muy mala administración de batería.",1
Nice phone!,1
"If you are looking for a solid 5G phone this is the one to get. Not only is it one of the cheaper 5G phones you can get. It also sports a huge battery. I would say I am a light to moderate user and I have pushed the phone to get 3 days on a single charge with charge left to spare. My last phone, Moto G7, I was lucky to get a day and a half of usage.The build quality is solid for such a budget phone and although other reviewers complained about the camera quality I think it is perfect. I thought having the fingerprint reader on the side of the phone would be awkward but I have gotten used to it quickly.It sports a lower end CPU but everything I have thrown at it works like a charm. Overall I am very glad I bought the phone and would recommend it to a friend as a great budget option.",1
"Like always, blu, is a great móvil.....thanks",0
It has all the latest features and is clear and has great resolutions. Great phone,1
"I need a phone to browse the web, access some media apps, read books, use chat apps, use maps, maintain my calendar, and send texts/calls.  That's it.  The occasional video watching, too.This phone is glorious, the battery life is huge (I can go 2.5-3 days without recharging).  It doesn't get warm when used for long periods.  It is much faster than my way old outdated phone.Unless you consume media (streaming, videos, active gaming) predominantly on your phone, this one is fantastic.  And it met all of my needs and then some.  Fingerprint scanner can be a little fussy, but thankfully it's not really high on my needs.",0

"For the price great phone. It was just a bit tat slow for my wife. She yelled at me for taking too long to send her driving directions to her phone. When in reality my phone was just ""slow"" to her flagship Pixel 5 standards to open up Google maps. I like the phone. The one complain will be the front facing camera hole. Around that area there's a shadow like smudge. I've seen it on display models at BestBuy too. I think it's just a poor quality panel that OnePlus just on the phone. But I mean for the price you can't really complain its really a good phone.",0
I now own two of these phones,1

"Pros- affordable, quick connection to internet.  I like the larger keypad that comes bc of larger screen.  I haven't used facial or fingerprint recognition to review.Cons- feels heavy compared to the S8.  Too many apps in the set up.  Some are mine of course.  It is so different from my Samsung's, which were so easy to upgrade from a previous model S.Battery life A+I'm not super tech savyThat said, a month out, and I am getting used to it.For around a $250+- it is a good phone.",1
"Previously I've had Motorola phones and they're mostly ok. I've only had this one for a month+, so it's too soon to know how it will hold up. However, so far it is an excellent phone, especially for the money. Responds quickly and the battery life is impressive. I like that the power and volume buttons are on different sides of the phone. Display is good and the exterior doesn't look or feel cheap. Bluetooth functions much better than my previous budget phones. It also charges quickly. I can't find much to fault it.",0
One Plus Nord 200 cell phone has an issue with sending a photo as an attachment.The camera produces a very large mega pixel image.  Unfortunately the N200 has no way of condensingthe image in order to send it as an email or text.  The image needs to be less than 480x600 pixels.  A third party condensing and/or cropping program is required to reduce the image size for transmission.,1
Muy buen,0
"This phone is an excellent value for what you need in a mobile device. It does not have all the high end specs, but it does what those specs would otherwise do very well. Can’t go wrong with this buy…….",1
Phone with duo is a treatEmail is goodCalenders schedule invaluable Camera is fine and I wisthe keyboard could be larger.h,0
"I normally buy an unlocked Android every 2 years. I go generic or off brand. This is my third OnePlus. It's by far my worst experience.The phone is just slow and horribly buggy. I had to do navigation for my wife while driving. By the time the app loads we have passed our exit.When I have to take a picture of the kids, by the time my phone unlocks and the camera application has loaded the moment has passed.Sometimes I'll need to do something with my Tesla car with my phone. I look like an idiot waiting on this stupid phone to load so I can open my car charging port.It also works in about 90% of the places my wife's phone works on TMobile.My ownership experience has been mostly disappointment and frustration. I can't recommend this to anyone who isn't on a budget or desperate.",1
Llego en tiempo y forma. Recomendable,1
Excellent value,1
The lack of complaining from my son due to his previous cell phone battery life has been heaven to my ears all for under $250 (with micro SD card and phone case). The only thing I would change is buying when I first saw it posted on Amazon.,1
Very few phones in this price range to so many features. Only problem finger scanner works but it is slow. Occasional phone stalls due to too many apps running (usual android problem unless to clear frequently). Camera is meh. Audio is good for 1 speaker.,1

"I am a bottom feeder. I like to get a lot for a little $. When I saw the price and what this phone does and what is packed in this phone, there was some doubt that it was that good. Sometimes 'cheap' phones are actually cheap but also lack function and are disappointing. This ONEPLUS N200 5G - actually delivers.The N200 looks good. The screen is bright and responds fast. The fingerprint reader is positioned a little higher than I like but not enough to make it not pleasing to use. If you do not like to use fingerprint then use the face recognition. The N200 is very fast. The size of the phone is large but it is slightly a little narrow. This makes for fitting in a hand comfortable. The back is plastic but then a phone case will protect it.It is Android with what ONEPLUS calls 'Oxygen'. This means a few 'bells and whistles' make the phone fun to use. If you used Samsung or Motorola there is a very little learning curve.I purchased this phone based upon Amazon's return policy. If i did not like the phone then I would return it and get something I do like. This phone is a keeper. I like it. I like it a lot!I read many reviews about this phone and almost everything about this phone was favorable except the camera. I was very skeptical about the picture quality. After using the camera and being critical I decided it is not that bad. I compared the photos to the new Apple iPhone SE 5G (2022). Yes the iPhone had better quality photos but not by much. The iPhone costs twice the price of the N200. The photos in the N200 are better than Motorola G7 Plus phone. The N200 phone is acceptable for photos in my opinion.One thing you cannot beat is the price of this phone.",1

"The phone came quickly, but when I opened it, the seal on the box wasn't there, and the phone was covered in fingerprints. The protective cover wasn't attached. Buyers beware.Working on getting a replacement with Amazon. If replacement comes as actually new, I will update the review.Update: Replacement phone came quickly and was factory sealed. Kudos to Amazon support, but this should have been unnecessary.",1
I ordered Google Fi 5G SIM cards and put one in a google pixel 5 and a data only sim in a netgear nighthawk m5. With both of this devices I could hardly get a 5G signal. Mostly only a LTE signal. With the pixel I had to stand at the window to get the signal. Then I ordered the One Plus Nord 200 5G. With this phone I get a strong signal in my house and the hotspot feature works great.,0
I've received the kind of performance with this phone that I'd expect from a budget phone from 2012. Constant freezing that's so bad that even restarting the phone is nearly impossible. Save your money. This phone is trash.,1

"This phone is pretty much a disappointment. I've owned a number of iPhones and Android devices in the past, from $800+ devices down to $200 phones like this one. I cannot recall when was the last time I had such a terrible phone. After a month of use, I'm throwing it in the trash to buy another. Money wasted.To summarize its specs and how they actually are:- The screen is advertised as a big thing, but forget about it! You're never gonna get 90 Hz because the processor cannot keep up. Scrolling through messages or Instagram feed you see lag, so what's the point of a 90Hz capable screen if it lags and you see it at 30 Hz? Color accuracy is good though- The phone's performance is the worst I've seen in the past decade! Forget about multitasking, with no open background apps, when I go to the supermarket I cannot switch between the shopping list app and the coupons app, because every time I switch the apps reload from the beginning. Screen lags, apps take forever to open, and I'm not even talking about games. Never had such a slow and frustrating experience texting, as the phone can't keep up with my typing on the keyboard nor scrolling through threads.- The camera is absolute potato. Remember to grab another camera with you because this is the absolute worst. For fun I compared the camera with that of my previous phones, and found it to be mostly similar in various lightning conditions to that of my Sony Ericsson C901, released in 2009!!!- The battery is huge and great, I can get a full day of power out of the phone with no issue. If the phone wasn't so slow and I did not have to wait for a minute for snapchat to open or type messages over and over again until the keyboard keeps up, my screen time would be inferior and I bet the battery would last even longer.- The fingerprint reader is slow and makes mistakes more times that it unlocks the phone. Face scan is also pretty much useless, as it depends on the camera which is potato. The last time I had a phone without a biometric unlock was 2014. Today, I am dragged 7 years back in time to once again use passwords to unlock my phone. It's extremely frustratingSTAY AWAY! Buy Xiaomi",0

"Not a bad phone for its price, works pretty stable, but what bother me most:- Display. Very dim with bad black level. Any brightness values below 50% are not usable, even in the dark. Automatic brightness is a joke and it should be turned off immediately.- Terrible Camera. Not usable at all. My 10-year-old phone can take better pictures.- Location for volume buttons looks nice for a first, but I constantly make a snapshot when trying to unlock the phone with my left hand using fingerprint reader. My gallery is filled with snapshots of a lock screens. For face unlock you need to turn phone first, that lead to taking another screenshot...- Red oneplus accent on all ""1"" numbers, lock screen, widgets and etc,  that cannot be changed. This is annoying.- ""horizon light"" blink only once on a notification, useless feature. AOD is a joke as well... don't use.Not a bad phone for its price, but could be much better with software updates... Bad, nothing want to fix it... Sight.",1
"Being in I.T. I think it's important to use and be comfortable with other technology. I'm a die-hard Apple fanboy. But, I've been really impressed with this device. I like the available face unlock and fingerprint sensor. Both are incredibly fast. Using it for day-to-day task I prefer the larger screen over my iPhone 13 Pro.It is lacking IMHO to any Apple device as far as the ecosystem. But, if I was told I could only use an Android phone this would be a great place to start. The interfaces are smooth and quick to respond. Sometimes the face unlock is even a little too fast (I don't get to read the notifications on the lock screen before it unlocks with my face and dives into the home page).I've never used OnePlus devices before but I had a feeling it wouldn't disappoint.",0

i like this phone - i havent use the camera yet - easy to use-loud speaker thats big plus for me -fast responses- very good screen quility - a gaming button feature- more features than i would use. and the price is right. i just cant see spending big bucks on a phone when they all  basically do the same thing. oh and also works with mint mobile service,1
"I purchased this phone to use as my second device. Honestly, for the money it has not disappointed me. When purchasing phones at this price point, there is always a little give and take when it comes to performance and features. However, I do think OnePlus has struck a nice balance with this model.When I unboxed it the first thing that struck me was the build quality. This absolutely maintains the form factor of their more expensive devices. My primary phone is a OnePlus 8T and this is definitely reminiscent of that.As far as the features and performance is concerned, everything works as it is supposed to. I am actually very impressed by the side mounted fingerprint sensor which doubles as the power button. It works quickly and efficiently and I really feel that even they're more expensive devices should have this feature. In addition, the screen resolution and viewing angles are very sharp and the phones battery power is amazing. I am also very impressed with the single firing speaker at the bottom of the device. A lot of companies tend to cheap out on their speakers when it comes to their more affordable devices. Fortunately, the sound is crisp and clear and definitely not tinny.Connectivity has definitely not been a problem since I purchased the phone. I am not only getting 4G LTE connections but, 5G is connecting exactly how it should. Although, when it comes to factory unlocked OnePlus devices 5G is only capable on the T-Mobile network and it's other carriers such as Metro by t-mobile, mint mobile and many others. Thus, don't expect to get 5G on networks like AT&t, Verizon and their subsidiaries because, it will not happen.Oneplus decided to equip this phone with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 480 5G processor which is rated at 2.0 GHz per second. They also equipped the phone with 4 GB of RAM. The best way to describe the processing performance is steady and reliable. It is not the fastest processor in the world but, it will get the job done. After all, this is a $240 phone and not one of their $1,000 models. Frankly, you cannot expect flagship performance like you would get with the Snapdragon 865 chipset or the Snapdragon 888. Again, it is not the fastest processor in the world but, it is not the slowest by far. You will have absolutely no problems performing day-to-day tasks, streaming movies and even gaming to a degree. Moreover, the 90 Hertz screen refresh rate definitely compensates for a lot of this.Understand, I am reading this device for what it is and not based on what it's not. If you are looking for a reliable good looking smartphone and you don't want to pay a lot of money then this is really the device you want. I have used it for about a month now and I am very happy with it. I would definitely not hesitate to recommend it.",0
Size is a bit big.,0
I am using it now and it fells smoother that me iphone 12 pro max. GET IT FOR THE PRICE.,0
It's working very good so far,0
Good phone with Cheap price,1
"Seems great so far. New 5G tower about 100 feet from the house so it always getting 5 bars now. It's heavy but the price for a mega sized battery. Seems snappy and responds well. I am not a power user of smart phones but of computers so if i can run a few apps that are not games and it does it well, I am happy. I am happy. The display is gorgeous and the camera is good but not if you think you are some auteur. I am using it with Mint mobile and the two have a very low cost of ownership.",0
"I love OnePlus phones, they are great and they deliver much much more than other phones,",0
"I am a multi phone user. When it came to investing in a phone for work I did my research and looked for the most middle middle performing phone out there. This was it. It has performed above expectations without overachieving and does not compete with my higher end flagships. But as a solid phone with the ability to get some mileage out of it for the cost, the battery and okay performance this phone is good.",1

But not many as fast as this one for the same amount of money. Overall I'm happy with the purchase after having had it for a couple of months.",1

Good good 👍,1
"Even though it says ""Unlocked"" It only works on GSM Carriers it says on verizon it's compatable but you put a verizon sim in it and it says ""No Service"" WTF?

"Can't enlarge the keyboard to a size anywhere close to sufficient for seniors. Can't find any gps on it. Seems like a VERY lite android version, which is inconvenient. Cameras are very bad. Battery life is great! I appreciate the 64gb internal storage. I never use face recognition or fingerprint readers as I find them ridiculous and unnecessary unless you are hoping to send that extra info for  governmental use. Looks and feels good/quality. I don't hate it but can't recommend it either. For the price it's barely ok.",1
I am very happy with this phone. Highly recommend,1
I live in a town.so make sure your provider service is compatible. i found AT&T and Verison are. i love this phone.,0
"El teléfono es una excelente opción cuando buscas una relación precio calidad, está excelente para el precio, el lector de huellas lo tiene en el botón de encendido, tiene reconocimiento facial para desbloquear, la batería dura bastante tiempo con el teléfono en uso constante, la calidad de imagen de la pantalla es muy buena y el teléfono es 5G! Los contras son la cámara en general no es la mejor, no tiene un botón para poner el celular en vibración. Es general me gusta!",0
"Last android phone I had worked beautifully but it overheated so I bought this one. MISTAKE it does not interact with either my laptop or PC. have tried every everything in Windows 10's arsenal but to no avail, it will only charge and install the ""One Plus Drivers"" then does nothing. Camera is ok on screen but cannot download pics onto PC or Laptop so no way to really tell if they are clear or not. This downloading of pics is important to me in that I have so many things I want to sell as I downsize and this just is not possible with this phone. If I'm doing something in the phone and a call comes in, no way to answer it, it puts up all sorts of hindering screens and must then call the person back. No way to ""Block"" callers and try to help with these issues is about as effective as trying to push your car up a mountain. I will not buy another Nord product. just wish I had taken the time to check it completely out before return time was up, but I thought I could figure it out. Nope, gonna throw it in trash and buy something else. Can't comment on those ""other"" features of fingerprint reader and face recognition as I've no use for those gimmicks. Battery life seems ok but does take a long time to charge so I keep it plugged in when possible.",0
"I used this phone for 3 days with minor signal problems and then I got no data suddenly and I found out that I supposed to contact my provider to activate something to make this phone work.  In general, you insert your sim card in the phone and you are ready to go, so there are some design problems with oneplus phones.  It is oneplus responsibility to make their phones work before leaving factory.  I am not going to spend my own time and stress to call customer services to make the phone work and pray it will work after that.  So I decided to get a refund and got a phone from another brand.  And surely, I insert my sim card in the phone and right away I have no problem with my new phone.",1
It's a phone. choose your provider and buy an expansion SSD for it. do not forget to format the new SSD after you install it.,0
"This is far and away the worst cellphone i have ever paid for; i was forced to buy a 5g phone due to carrier nonsense. The memory amount is low, and the ""swap"" is too aggressive. if i get a text message while in an app like twitter or whatever, when i come back to twitter it needs to reload everything, because android swaps out the twitter stuff to display the SMS interface. It does this for every app. In a messaging app and click a link? after you close out the browser it needs to reload the messaging app. This makes using this phone a tedious nightmare for anything beyond ""texting"".The screen is either too dim or way too bright, everything in the middle is ""almost too dim"" and ""almost too bright"" with no ""perfect"" setting. The automatic dimming function is hot garbage. The screen itself is pretty low quality, compared to other $200-$250 phones.The cameras may as well not even be there. While they're better than the flip phone era cameras, the image quality this phone outputs is embarrassing. So i have to carry two phones or a phone and a camera to be able to freely take decent pictures anywhere, like i am used to.The battery life is pretty atrocious. I think this is partially due to the screen being low quality and often too bright, and the ""disk"" / storage writes to swap out apps due to low memory. It also requires a *different* type of charger than every other phone on the market. You have QC or IQ or PD chargers already? Well no fast charging on the Oneplus Nord N200 5g. 1% every two minutes. They use DASH or WARP or something. It isn't worth paying extra for a car charger and a charger ""for the office"" - which you will wish you had, because this battery isn't lasting all day, that's for sure.The gyroscopic sensors are bad. Every time i unlock the phone it ""quickly"" switches from portrait to landscape back to portrait, no matter how i hold it while unlocking. I put quickly in quotes because this whole thing takes about 4-5 seconds to settle on portrait mode. Every time i unlock it.Bluetooth always requires fiddling - It will connect to, for instance, a car stereo. Then Disconnect. Then you have to go into bluetooth settings and manually click the car's bluetooth name. Then it might work, about 60% of the time. This is another few minutes a few times a day wasted waiting on this phone.I cannot figure out where the $200-$235 i spent on this phone actually went. Every feature is poor. This phone costs me about 20-30 minutes *every day* in waiting for it to do stuff that phones have been doing for 12 years without any issues.I will say, and the reason it gets 2 stars instead of 1, that the phone call quality is decent, and the speaker is passable. 5g doesn't seem any faster than 4g, but that's a carrier thing, probably. I haven't tested this on other carriers, so it is possible that the modem inside is faster than an LTE modem, but i really doubt it. It's probably the same CAT level as bargain basement LTE phones have.Just stay away from this phone, unless you just need the phone app and a messaging/SMS app. it's ""ok"" at both of those things.",0
"Great little phone feels much more expensive than it is.Screen Quality - 7/10 - Nice, Could be better in lots of light but at this price point greatBattery Life  9/10 - Fantastic has gone multiple days of light use without chargingFingerprint Reader 8/10 - Misses sometimes but pretty accurateOS 9/10  - New to android and seems very fluid and intuitiveValue 10/10 - Perfect cant beat itHand Feel 8/10 - Can be a little awkward to hold but its overall niceOverall Rating 9/10 - Really enjoying the experience and really cheap with mint service",0
I ordered Google Fi 5G SIM cards and put one in a google pixel 5 and a data only sim in a netgear nighthawk m5. With both of this devices I could hardly get a 5G signal. Mostly only a LTE signal. With the pixel I had to stand at the window to get the signal. Then I ordered the One Plus Nord 200 5G. With this phone I get a strong signal in my house and the hotspot feature works great.,0
"The new phone is nice, but I am having a difficult time learning the features and finding things.  It would be very helpful if there was a printed manual for me to refer to rather than stumble upon a feature.  Fingerprint opening of phone worked well until I put a cover on it, now the button is lower and does not always read my print.",1
Good Case,0
"First  this phone is unlocked, as advertised.  Don't understand why someone said it wasn't unless they bought the wrong phone. Bought it for my son who is thrilled with it.  Put in sim from old phone and there it was, ready, just needed charging.  It works as well as my iphone.  Good midprice phone 5 G, which should last a good while.",1
"Bought 2 of these to use on T-Mobile in the U.S.  T-Mobile says they're locked, international versions, and can NOT be activated on their network.  So the description ""5G Unlocked Android Smartphone U.S Version"" is only partly correct - they run Android.  All the  rest is false.  Seller was: Amazon.com Services LLC .",1
"This phone was not unlocked to att. While playing with it, you notice slow and laggy usage. There was constant app crashing (chase). The face recognition was okay. The figure print is confusing. Since I am right-handed, the phone is usually in my left hand while I hold it. But the fingerprint scanner is on the right side of the phone, the right thumb is needed. So you have to unlock it with your right hand and switch over to the left hand every time. Overall a very bad experience, even this cheap, you couldn't pay me to use it.",1
I have enjoyed setting this Android 11 phone up and enjoying all of it's capabilities. Good buy for the money !,1
"I bought this cell for my daughter who is an aerospace engineering student at UCF in Orlando FL.It works extremely well in our area of Kissimmee which is notorious for bad cell reception. Mint Mobile's coverage and cost along with  the OnePlus Nord N200 | 5G has helped her through the pandemic and online courses as well as her association responsibilities. I can't say enough good things about this cell phone, having had numerous others prior to it. I strongly recommend to anyone who wants an affordable, dependable cell to help them get through our hectic lives.",1
"Bought replace my TCL10L. Camera is OK. The OS is clean and tidy though the launcher crashes with ever restart. The lack of RAM is an issue. Constantly. Really annoyed. Used as a daily, now it's going in the drawer to serve as a backup. Screen had begun to display scrolling horizontal flickering. Constantly hangs. Three months of use and all updated STILL it's awful.This phone is Truly one of the worst phones I've had. DO NOT BUY. OnePlus won't accept it for trade in. LET THAT SINK IN. Every phone they have made in the past 5 years is up for trade in, EXCEPT this one. They dont even want it. Customer service is awful. This phone sucks.UPDATE 12/3/21....THIS PHONE IS AN UNDERPOWERED OVERATED PIECE OF JUNKUPDATE 1/6/22....SOLD! To someone in Florida. Last good phone I had was a Samsung so I went back with them, S20 FE and holy cow. Wow wow wow.",1
"I was happy with my oneplus 5T, but it was starting to get a bit unreliable. I was looking for an excuse to upgrade to a 5g phone, and this seemed like a good deal. I was familiar with the companies work on budget phones before and decided, what the heck!BOY WAS I WRONG... Sort ofThis phone is good enough for me not to return it. That's. It.It is NOT good enough for me to not have an issue with it.It's a short list for me but heavy hitting in my assessment.Start with the positives,The screen is real nice, I was a bit worried with it not being oled, but it looks good very clean. Not too reflective in sunlight, and the blacks are black.I appreciate the headphone jack and that was big in my decision for searching for a phone.NegativesTyping on this... Takes some getting used to, if you use typing vibrations they make the whole experience feel mushy, almost as if the vibration motor isn't at full power, short vibrations very weak and not ""buzzy"".The camera on this thing is a piece of work,The system is built in with image beautification that is a huge pain in the butt. In the camera app you can turn it off and manage to get an, ""on par"" picture you'd be expecting.However, if you use any apps that use a camera ie. Snapchat, tough luck, not setting for you.I am extremely dissatisfied with the camera.All this being said, I think to myself. ""you just bought this phone for $210, in 2022, shut up""Only taking price into consideration, it's an ok deal, especially if you don't use the camera.Taking into consideration OnePlus's history with challenging what can be done in a budget device... Kinda feels like I'm settling with this one.If i was still looking for phone, I'd pass this one up.",1
I live in a town.so make sure your provider service is compatible. i found AT&T and Verison are. i love this phone.,1
Great mobile,1
Slow. Slow and slower.  This phone is much slower than my 7+ when it was out of storage even.  It's was hell activating with ATT.  I was told it will not work come Feb. even though it is listed as one that will. That's all on Att.  I'm a OnePlus fan. I would never recommend this device to anyone.,0
Battery could be alittle better but over a great phone!,1
"Not a bad phone for its price, works pretty stable, but what bother me most:- Display. Very dim with bad black level. Any brightness values below 50% are not usable, even in the dark. Automatic brightness is a joke and it should be turned off immediately.- Terrible Camera. Not usable at all. My 10-year-old phone can take better pictures.- Location for volume buttons looks nice for a first, but I constantly make a snapshot when trying to unlock the phone with my left hand using fingerprint reader. My gallery is filled with snapshots of a lock screens. For face unlock you need to turn phone first, that lead to taking another screenshot...- Red oneplus accent on all ""1"" numbers, lock screen, widgets and etc,  that cannot be changed. This is annoying.- ""horizon light"" blink only once on a notification, useless feature. AOD is a joke as well... don't use.Not a bad phone for its price, but could be much better with software updates... Bad, nothing want to fix it... Sight.",0
 Where's the phone? It's got the charger but that's all. 😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬,1
Very pleased.  I had to upgrade from Nokia 3.1 because of 5G.  The phone is perfect.,1
"ATT forcing the 5g rollout so we had to get new phones.  OnePlus has a tag line ""Never Settle"" but we definitely settled with this device.  I purchased a Poco NFC the end of 2019 and that phone is light years faster than the OnePlus. The OnePlus constantly hangs trying to open simple apps. One time I wanted to take a picture of something but the camera app never opened. I have to constantly restart this phone when it freezes. Everything about this phone is slow.  I suggest look to another company before buying this ""phone"".",1
"I purchased this phone to use as my second device. Honestly, for the money it has not disappointed me. When purchasing phones at this price point, there is always a little give and take when it comes to performance and features. However, I do think OnePlus has struck a nice balance with this model.When I unboxed it the first thing that struck me was the build quality. This absolutely maintains the form factor of their more expensive devices. My primary phone is a OnePlus 8T and this is definitely reminiscent of that.As far as the features and performance is concerned, everything works as it is supposed to. I am actually very impressed by the side mounted fingerprint sensor which doubles as the power button. It works quickly and efficiently and I really feel that even they're more expensive devices should have this feature. In addition, the screen resolution and viewing angles are very sharp and the phones battery power is amazing. I am also very impressed with the single firing speaker at the bottom of the device. A lot of companies tend to cheap out on their speakers when it comes to their more affordable devices. Fortunately, the sound is crisp and clear and definitely not tinny.Connectivity has definitely not been a problem since I purchased the phone. I am not only getting 4G LTE connections but, 5G is connecting exactly how it should. Although, when it comes to factory unlocked OnePlus devices 5G is only capable on the T-Mobile network and it's other carriers such as Metro by t-mobile, mint mobile and many others. Thus, don't expect to get 5G on networks like AT&t, Verizon and their subsidiaries because, it will not happen.Oneplus decided to equip this phone with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 480 5G processor which is rated at 2.0 GHz per second. They also equipped the phone with 4 GB of RAM. The best way to describe the processing performance is steady and reliable. It is not the fastest processor in the world but, it will get the job done. After all, this is a $240 phone and not one of their $1,000 models. Frankly, you cannot expect flagship performance like you would get with the Snapdragon 865 chipset or the Snapdragon 888. Again, it is not the fastest processor in the world but, it is not the slowest by far. You will have absolutely no problems performing day-to-day tasks, streaming movies and even gaming to a degree. Moreover, the 90 Hertz screen refresh rate definitely compensates for a lot of this.Understand, I am reading this device for what it is and not based on what it's not. If you are looking for a reliable good looking smartphone and you don't want to pay a lot of money then this is really the device you want. I have used it for about a month now and I am very happy with it. I would definitely not hesitate to recommend it.",1
It's a phone. choose your provider and buy an expansion SSD for it. do not forget to format the new SSD after you install it.,1

"The cellphone was large and heavier than expected. So I didn't even turn it on. I returned it immediately. The seller didn't have a valid return tracking with UPS. Since 7-22-2022, the return wasn't processed.",1
"Being in I.T. I think it's important to use and be comfortable with other technology. I'm a die-hard Apple fanboy. But, I've been really impressed with this device. I like the available face unlock and fingerprint sensor. Both are incredibly fast. Using it for day-to-day task I prefer the larger screen over my iPhone 13 Pro.It is lacking IMHO to any Apple device as far as the ecosystem. But, if I was told I could only use an Android phone this would be a great place to start. The interfaces are smooth and quick to respond. Sometimes the face unlock is even a little too fast (I don't get to read the notifications on the lock screen before it unlocks with my face and dives into the home page).I've never used OnePlus devices before but I had a feeling it wouldn't disappoint.",0
Its an ok budget phone. Pros: great batt and nice screen. Cons: camera is terrible and it's a little slow.,1
Phone is of excellent quality and works very well. Calling at a 5G telephone is a stretch it's 5G only to T-Mobile. Other than that it's a 4G telephone and will not work on AT&t network as 5G. I paid for my lesson. The phone is a quality phone.,1
"I've been using One plus phones since their very first model back when they used their lottery/invite system. Since then, I e only had a phone from them. That being said, this is possibly the worst model they've produced. Granted, it's priced very affordably, but the OS for this model makes the phone unusable sometimes. Battery life is good, camera is decent, and graphics are good. However, the sheer aggressiveness of the underlying battery saving system software means that every app you open gets closed in the background. What this means is that if you swap between apps, its likely that the background app will get closed and forced to restart when you switch back. When working on multiple things or even just switching between a browser and an app, you become very frustrated quickly. It's highly likely I'll be getting rid of this phone and getting a different model.",1
"Phone is snappy in menus but slows down when starting and ending calls, this includes whatsapp or messenger calls.  It seems when connecting any type of call the added network load is a bit too much for the processing units. Other than this very minor annoyance, One+ seem to think It's OK for them to not allow you to turn their own advertisement and app notifications, so basically you can turn off any other app notifications except the One+ apps.Phone was purchased for a pre-teen and the quality, speed, battery life to price ratio is great. Overall it's a quality device and does exactly what we needed it to do.  We are able to overlook the annoyances.",1
"I love OnePlus phones, they are great and they deliver much much more than other phones,",1
Nice,1
"For the price great phone. It was just a bit tat slow for my wife. She yelled at me for taking too long to send her driving directions to her phone. When in reality my phone was just ""slow"" to her flagship Pixel 5 standards to open up Google maps. I like the phone. The one complain will be the front facing camera hole. Around that area there's a shadow like smudge. I've seen it on display models at BestBuy too. I think it's just a poor quality panel that OnePlus just on the phone. But I mean for the price you can't really complain its really a good phone.",1
"The main issue I've experienced, although there were others as well, is with the Voice Mail function.  EVERY time that I raise the phone near my face to listen to a message, the message immediately stops playing.  I've been through the tech help procedure twice. You know, trying to follow test procedures given on the phone by someone with a barely understandable accent. Then getting my lengthy call escalated to another ""more qualified"" tech agent again in ASIA. Still had no success. I returned the phone as defective by their suggestion. I simply ordered an identical replacement phone. Guess what I got.  An identical problem as the first phone. These appear to be SUBSTANDARD phones to me. I cannot recommend a purchase of this phone to anyone.  I'm quite disappointed with it.  Also, it is now a true 5G phone as advertised. But that is another issue.  UDATE: Few days later, now the phone is completely unusable. It has gone berserk! I can't even describe all the bizarre things it is doing. I lost $200 and my mind over this useless phone. UPDATE: After a lengthy and eventful conversation with an Amazon Help agent I got some success. The phone went haywire. It even dialed EMERGENCY on its own. With the Sheriff knocking at my front door to check up on me due to the false emergency call, I got a little more ""animated"" with the Amazon agent via chat(the phone was inoperable) on my PC. Result? ""I've successfully process your refund amounting of $225.21 Your refund will reflect on your gift card balance within 1-3 hours.​"" Yeah for Amazon and the devil with OnePlus Nord N200 | 5G Unlocked Android Smartphone U.S Version.  I want nothing more to do with this phone or vendor",0
Love this phone,1
Good good 👍,0
- The camera on this phone is the worst of any phone or tablet ive ever used. The iphone 3G takes better pics than this.- The phone randomly stops charging on its own.- The 5G connection is slower than my old pixel on 4G- The screen is starting to develop smudges that cant be wiped off no matter how hard I try.** only had this phone 2 months and when I called oneplus they told me they dont provide replacements. They would only repair the phone if I mailed it in and I would be left without a phone for weeks. They insisted their warranty doesnt include replacements at all. Please buy a different phone or you'll regret it within 2 months.,1

"I am a bottom feeder. I like to get a lot for a little $. When I saw the price and what this phone does and what is packed in this phone, there was some doubt that it was that good. Sometimes 'cheap' phones are actually cheap but also lack function and are disappointing. This ONEPLUS N200 5G - actually delivers.The N200 looks good. The screen is bright and responds fast. The fingerprint reader is positioned a little higher than I like but not enough to make it not pleasing to use. If you do not like to use fingerprint then use the face recognition. The N200 is very fast. The size of the phone is large but it is slightly a little narrow. This makes for fitting in a hand comfortable. The back is plastic but then a phone case will protect it.It is Android with what ONEPLUS calls 'Oxygen'. This means a few 'bells and whistles' make the phone fun to use. If you used Samsung or Motorola there is a very little learning curve.I purchased this phone based upon Amazon's return policy. If i did not like the phone then I would return it and get something I do like. This phone is a keeper. I like it. I like it a lot!I read many reviews about this phone and almost everything about this phone was favorable except the camera. I was very skeptical about the picture quality. After using the camera and being critical I decided it is not that bad. I compared the photos to the new Apple iPhone SE 5G (2022). Yes the iPhone had better quality photos but not by much. The iPhone costs twice the price of the N200. The photos in the N200 are better than Motorola G7 Plus phone. The N200 phone is acceptable for photos in my opinion.One thing you cannot beat is the price of this phone.",0
"Perfect budget phone. Do not expect flagship features. I use iPhone 12 Pro Max and got this to have a second device as I need Android for work.Unlocking the screen is not the fastest. Face recognition doesn't work with glasses on, fingerprint is located on the side button(power button) I found it tricky cause i wake up the screen with double tap. Fingerprint reader works however not the best. Camera also is not satisfying, especially at night. But remember this is budget phone, and for this price i think it is pretty good deal. I will keep it.",0
I got two of these for my kids and they love them. Full featured device for less than half the cost of bigger named brands. Great deal for all but the biggest power users. I am seriously thinking of leaving the Samsung Galaxy lineup for my next upgrade and moving to this much more reasonably priced lineup.,1

"This is a Super Nice phone. These phones are (NOT) locked to T-Moblile. My carrier is AT&T. It has an advanced technology, operating system, function, and the fingerprint reader works better than any phone I've had. Having said that, it's very easy to setup. I have AT&T as my carrier, I just swaped the sim card from my old phone and it was ready to setup. Keep in mind this phone does have a Setup Wizard which guides you throught the process. It does have a slot for expandable memory. The technology of this phone works great, I have a pair of Raycon E55 earbuds that have the new 5.0 bluetooth technology (stereo sound) and they sounded awesome on my previous phone but they sound even better on this new N200 5G. I was conflicted between buying the N200 5G and N10 5G, both are very similar but personally I think the N200 5G is the better model. Do yourself a favor and spend an extra few dollars to buy the suggested phone protection case with a black surround. This phone is worth protecting the cameras on the back, against shock if dropped, and it will keep the phone from sliding around as it is very lightweight (but very good quality) and has a slick surface. I can't say enough about how impressive this phone is. Buy it!!!",1
This phone is better than Apple in every way. The camera is better the speed is better and everything people who review this phone does NOT know what they are talking about. With my iPhone 11 pro Max I would get so many typos it was ridiculous but with this phone not so many typos only time I would get typos if I accidently pushed the wrong button cause my hands are too big. The camera is beautiful it's not slow at all I don't know what these other so called reviewers are talking about but from now on I'm gonna be in the one plus family for a long time. I only had this phone for a couple of days and it's doing well so far which I like other people on here expect more from a budget phone like why would you put high end stuff that you can only find with a thousand dollar phone and put it in a budget phone it's called a budget phone for a reason idiots. The battery holds up great for me and with all the reviews saying you can't add it to Sprint or Verizon network then don't cry and complain about it put it on another network and if you can't just buy another phone it's not that hard. When I get my paycheck again I'm gonna be buying the OnePlus 9 and I'll be back to reviewing another great phone HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!! (Edit)This phone is trash now they're aren't new updates it's stuck on Android 11 and will not update it's slow and just good never get a cheap phone from a major company there will always be flaws.,0

The N200 phone is acceptable for photos in my opinion.One thing you cannot beat is the price of this phone.",0
It's working very good so far,1
Bought this as a gift for my sister and she likes the phone especially the long lasting battery life.It’s too early to give 5 stars but for now it’s doing the job exceptionally.,1
Needed to download torrents and other stuff iPhone can’t do. Love it as my second phone,0
"Very unimpressed with this phone. I had to replace my one-year-old Redmi Note 9 Pro phone because of the 5G transition required by the ISPs.  I LOVED the Redmi. I do not love--or even like a lot--the Nord OnePlus.The screen is dark:  to bring the light up to the level needed to illuminate the data/apps, particularly when using it outside, it drains the battery rather quickly.The quick app menu icons (e.g., to take screenshots) are ridiculously large, very asthetically DISpleasing. There is no way to make them smaller other than installing a brand-new app loader.The camera app they had preinstalled was demanding I give it access to contacts, phone numbers, etc. No, thank you!  I replaced the app with another one from GooglePlay, which, btw, is superior in its photo features and quality.Constant nagging from Nord to ""finish setting up"" the phone--which actually means insisting I join their ""community"".  No, Thank you!Slow charging. Not the super-fast speed they claim.",1

"This phone is not unlocked. It is T-Mobile Only. I have sprint, and even though they are a merged company they can not activate it, even with giving me a T-Mobile/Sprint SIM card. Sprint users- do not buy this phone. I can't speak for anyone else, but it definitely will not work for Sprint.",1

"Just about a month and a half old and so far so good. I was expecting the battery to be better. Sure, it's fast charging and that's great. But it can deplete fast too. I had an unknown Chinese branded phone before this and its battery lasted way longer than this one.",1
"Can't enlarge the keyboard to a size anywhere close to sufficient for seniors. Can't find any gps on it. Seems like a VERY lite android version, which is inconvenient. Cameras are very bad. Battery life is great! I appreciate the 64gb internal storage. I never use face recognition or fingerprint readers as I find them ridiculous and unnecessary unless you are hoping to send that extra info for  governmental use. Looks and feels good/quality. I don't hate it but can't recommend it either. For the price it's barely ok.",0
"Bought replace my TCL10L. Camera is OK. The OS is clean and tidy though the launcher crashes with ever restart. The lack of RAM is an issue. Constantly. Really annoyed. Used as a daily, now it's going in the drawer to serve as a backup. Screen had begun to display scrolling horizontal flickering. Constantly hangs. Three months of use and all updated STILL it's awful.This phone is Truly one of the worst phones I've had. DO NOT BUY. OnePlus won't accept it for trade in. LET THAT SINK IN. Every phone they have made in the past 5 years is up for trade in, EXCEPT this one. They dont even want it. Customer service is awful. This phone sucks.UPDATE 12/3/21....THIS PHONE IS AN UNDERPOWERED OVERATED PIECE OF JUNKUPDATE 1/6/22....SOLD! To someone in Florida. Last good phone I had was a Samsung so I went back with them, S20 FE and holy cow. Wow wow wow.",0

Even thought the phone have 3 cameras is difficult to get a fast shot.My trading apps runs smooth, also my games with the gaming mode runs like amazing!The fingerprint recognized fast the finger it remind me the old iPhone versions.I can say that the best feature of this phone is the battery it can last days among the the fast charging.If you find  yourself in a situation of a rush for a phone this is definitely your best option of the market.",0
"This phone comes with a 5G supported snapdragon chipset (400 series) and also shipped with a 5000mAh battery. I do understand that this is a budget phone but it does not do justice to its battery capacity.Firstly, if you just want an android phone 5G supported and with a large screen, this phone fits the requirement well. It has a 90Hz refresh rate screen and its max brightness is manageable in Arizona summer days. Has a fingerprint sensor on the unlock button. For day to day purposes, this phone can get most of the stuff done such as calls and emails. Light gaming can be done too but don't expect this to run heavy games like Genshin Impact (runs at 10 fps).The cameras are not good at all. Does not even take good quality photos even with ample light and the night mode is pretty non existent. It's portrait mode shots are much worser than that of the main camera. (Am I expecting too much from buget phones these days? Samsung buget segment can take better photos).Finally the battery: Initially it was great, lasted two whole days with 60 Hz and lasted a whole day with 15% left in the beginning of the following day with 90Hz mode. After about 5 months, it barely stays alive for a whole day with 60Hz screen running and if enable power saver mode, it lasts a couple more hours. (I am a light user btw).I would probably go with samsung for the budget segment, or if you can squeeze out some more during the black friday season, you probably can go for the pixel 6a phones.",1
This phone is better than Apple in every way. The camera is better the speed is better and everything people who review this phone does NOT know what they are talking about. With my iPhone 11 pro Max I would get so many typos it was ridiculous but with this phone not so many typos only time I would get typos if I accidently pushed the wrong button cause my hands are too big. The camera is beautiful it's not slow at all I don't know what these other so called reviewers are talking about but from now on I'm gonna be in the one plus family for a long time. I only had this phone for a couple of days and it's doing well so far which I like other people on here expect more from a budget phone like why would you put high end stuff that you can only find with a thousand dollar phone and put it in a budget phone it's called a budget phone for a reason idiots. The battery holds up great for me and with all the reviews saying you can't add it to Sprint or Verizon network then don't cry and complain about it put it on another network and if you can't just buy another phone it's not that hard. When I get my paycheck again I'm gonna be buying the OnePlus 9 and I'll be back to reviewing another great phone HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!! (Edit)This phone is trash now they're aren't new updates it's stuck on Android 11 and will not update it's slow and just good never get a cheap phone from a major company there will always be flaws.,1
"This is far and away the worst cellphone i have ever paid for; i was forced to buy a 5g phone due to carrier nonsense. The memory amount is low, and the ""swap"" is too aggressive. if i get a text message while in an app like twitter or whatever, when i come back to twitter it needs to reload everything, because android swaps out the twitter stuff to display the SMS interface. It does this for every app. In a messaging app and click a link? after you close out the browser it needs to reload the messaging app. This makes using this phone a tedious nightmare for anything beyond ""texting"".The screen is either too dim or way too bright, everything in the middle is ""almost too dim"" and ""almost too bright"" with no ""perfect"" setting. The automatic dimming function is hot garbage. The screen itself is pretty low quality, compared to other $200-$250 phones.The cameras may as well not even be there. While they're better than the flip phone era cameras, the image quality this phone outputs is embarrassing. So i have to carry two phones or a phone and a camera to be able to freely take decent pictures anywhere, like i am used to.The battery life is pretty atrocious. I think this is partially due to the screen being low quality and often too bright, and the ""disk"" / storage writes to swap out apps due to low memory. It also requires a *different* type of charger than every other phone on the market. You have QC or IQ or PD chargers already? Well no fast charging on the Oneplus Nord N200 5g. 1% every two minutes. They use DASH or WARP or something. It isn't worth paying extra for a car charger and a charger ""for the office"" - which you will wish you had, because this battery isn't lasting all day, that's for sure.The gyroscopic sensors are bad. Every time i unlock the phone it ""quickly"" switches from portrait to landscape back to portrait, no matter how i hold it while unlocking. I put quickly in quotes because this whole thing takes about 4-5 seconds to settle on portrait mode. Every time i unlock it.Bluetooth always requires fiddling - It will connect to, for instance, a car stereo. Then Disconnect. Then you have to go into bluetooth settings and manually click the car's bluetooth name. Then it might work, about 60% of the time. This is another few minutes a few times a day wasted waiting on this phone.I cannot figure out where the $200-$235 i spent on this phone actually went. Every feature is poor. This phone costs me about 20-30 minutes *every day* in waiting for it to do stuff that phones have been doing for 12 years without any issues.I will say, and the reason it gets 2 stars instead of 1, that the phone call quality is decent, and the speaker is passable. 5g doesn't seem any faster than 4g, but that's a carrier thing, probably. I haven't tested this on other carriers, so it is possible that the modem inside is faster than an LTE modem, but i really doubt it. It's probably the same CAT level as bargain basement LTE phones have.Just stay away from this phone, unless you just need the phone app and a messaging/SMS app. it's ""ok"" at both of those things.",1
"El teléfono es una excelente opción cuando buscas una relación precio calidad, está excelente para el precio, el lector de huellas lo tiene en el botón de encendido, tiene reconocimiento facial para desbloquear, la batería dura bastante tiempo con el teléfono en uso constante, la calidad de imagen de la pantalla es muy buena y el teléfono es 5G! Los contras son la cámara en general no es la mejor, no tiene un botón para poner el celular en vibración. Es general me gusta!",0

"I like the camera on this phone it takes nice clear photo's and the battery is long life and fast charging. I ended up paying too much for it though when I could have got it at my Metro PCS store for 120.00 set up, I ended up paying over 300.00 with it being switched and a case. Next time I'm going to look at the store before I go and order one. The only problem with this phone is that during call's sometimes the speaker phone will not work on the first try.",1
"This phone is pretty much a disappointment. I've owned a number of iPhones and Android devices in the past, from $800+ devices down to $200 phones like this one. I cannot recall when was the last time I had such a terrible phone. After a month of use, I'm throwing it in the trash to buy another. Money wasted.To summarize its specs and how they actually are:- The screen is advertised as a big thing, but forget about it! You're never gonna get 90 Hz because the processor cannot keep up. Scrolling through messages or Instagram feed you see lag, so what's the point of a 90Hz capable screen if it lags and you see it at 30 Hz? Color accuracy is good though- The phone's performance is the worst I've seen in the past decade! Forget about multitasking, with no open background apps, when I go to the supermarket I cannot switch between the shopping list app and the coupons app, because every time I switch the apps reload from the beginning. Screen lags, apps take forever to open, and I'm not even talking about games. Never had such a slow and frustrating experience texting, as the phone can't keep up with my typing on the keyboard nor scrolling through threads.- The camera is absolute potato. Remember to grab another camera with you because this is the absolute worst. For fun I compared the camera with that of my previous phones, and found it to be mostly similar in various lightning conditions to that of my Sony Ericsson C901, released in 2009!!!- The battery is huge and great, I can get a full day of power out of the phone with no issue. If the phone wasn't so slow and I did not have to wait for a minute for snapchat to open or type messages over and over again until the keyboard keeps up, my screen time would be inferior and I bet the battery would last even longer.- The fingerprint reader is slow and makes mistakes more times that it unlocks the phone. Face scan is also pretty much useless, as it depends on the camera which is potato. The last time I had a phone without a biometric unlock was 2014. Today, I am dragged 7 years back in time to once again use passwords to unlock my phone. It's extremely frustratingSTAY AWAY! Buy Xiaomi",0

"The main issue I've experienced, although there were others as well, is with the Voice Mail function.  EVERY time that I raise the phone near my face to listen to a message, the message immediately stops playing.  I've been through the tech help procedure twice. You know, trying to follow test procedures given on the phone by someone with a barely understandable accent. Then getting my lengthy call escalated to another ""more qualified"" tech agent again in ASIA. Still had no success. I returned the phone as defective by their suggestion. I simply ordered an identical replacement phone. Guess what I got.  An identical problem as the first phone. These appear to be SUBSTANDARD phones to me. I cannot recommend a purchase of this phone to anyone.  I'm quite disappointed with it.  Also, it is now a true 5G phone as advertised. But that is another issue.  UDATE: Few days later, now the phone is completely unusable. It has gone berserk! I can't even describe all the bizarre things it is doing. I lost $200 and my mind over this useless phone. UPDATE: After a lengthy and eventful conversation with an Amazon Help agent I got some success. The phone went haywire. It even dialed EMERGENCY on its own. With the Sheriff knocking at my front door to check up on me due to the false emergency call, I got a little more ""animated"" with the Amazon agent via chat(the phone was inoperable) on my PC. Result? ""I've successfully process your refund amounting of $225.21 Your refund will reflect on your gift card balance within 1-3 hours.​"" Yeah for Amazon and the devil with OnePlus Nord N200 | 5G Unlocked Android Smartphone U.S Version.

"If you are looking for a solid 5G phone this is the one to get. Not only is it one of the cheaper 5G phones you can get. It also sports a huge battery. I would say I am a light to moderate user and I have pushed the phone to get 3 days on a single charge with charge left to spare. My last phone, Moto G7, I was lucky to get a day and a half of usage.The build quality is solid for such a budget phone and although other reviewers complained about the camera quality I think it is perfect. I thought having the fingerprint reader on the side of the phone would be awkward but I have gotten used to it quickly.It sports a lower end CPU but everything I have thrown at it works like a charm.

i like this phone - i havent use the camera yet - easy to use-loud speaker thats big plus for me -fast responses- very good screen quility - a gaming button feature- more features than i would use. and the price is right. i just cant see spending big bucks on a phone when they all  basically do the same thing. oh and also works with mint mobile service,0

"I was happy with my oneplus 5T, but it was starting to get a bit unreliable. I was looking for an excuse to upgrade to a 5g phone, and this seemed like a good deal. I was familiar with the companies work on budget phones before and decided, what the heck!BOY WAS I WRONG... Sort ofThis phone is good enough for me not to return it. That's. It.It is NOT good enough for me to not have an issue with it.It's a short list for me but heavy hitting in my assessment.Start with the positives,The screen is real nice, I was a bit worried with it not being oled, but it looks good very clean. Not too reflective in sunlight, and the blacks are black.I appreciate the headphone jack and that was big in my decision for searching for a phone.NegativesTyping on this... Takes some getting used to, if you use typing vibrations they make the whole experience feel mushy, almost as if the vibration motor isn't at full power, short vibrations very weak and not ""buzzy"".The camera on this thing is a piece of work,The system is built in with image beautification that is a huge pain in the butt. In the camera app you can turn it off and manage to get an, ""on par"" picture you'd be expecting.However, if you use any apps that use a camera ie. Snapchat, tough luck, not setting for you.I am extremely dissatisfied with the camera.All this being said, I think to myself. ""you just bought this phone for $210, in 2022, shut up""Only taking price into consideration, it's an ok deal, especially if you don't use the camera.Taking into consideration OnePlus's history with challenging what can be done in a budget device... Kinda feels like I'm settling with this one.If i was still looking for phone, I'd pass this one up.",0

By the time the app loads we have passed our exit.When I have to take a picture of the kids, by the time my phone unlocks and the camera application has loaded the moment has passed.Sometimes I'll need to do something with my Tesla car with my phone. I look like an idiot waiting on this stupid phone to load so I can open my car charging port.It also works in about 90% of the places my wife's phone works on TMobile.My ownership experience has been mostly disappointment and frustration. I can't recommend this to anyone who isn't on a budget or desperate.",0

"I purchased this phone to use as my second device. Honestly, for the money it has not disappointed me. When purchasing phones at this price point, there is always a little give and take when it comes to performance and features. However, I do think OnePlus has struck a nice balance with this model.When I unboxed it the first thing that struck me was the build quality. This absolutely maintains the form factor of their more expensive devices. My primary phone is a OnePlus 8T and this is definitely reminiscent of that.As far as the features and performance is concerned, everything works as it is supposed to. I am actually very impressed by the side mounted fingerprint sensor which doubles as the power button. It works quickly and efficiently and I really feel that even they're more expensive devices should have this feature. In addition, the screen resolution and viewing angles are very sharp and the phones battery power is amazing. I am also very impressed with the single firing speaker at the bottom of the device. A lot of companies tend to cheap out on their speakers when it comes to their more affordable devices. Fortunately, the sound is crisp and clear and definitely not tinny.Connectivity has definitely not been a problem since I purchased the phone. I am not only getting 4G LTE connections but, 5G is connecting exactly how it should. Although, when it comes to factory unlocked OnePlus devices 5G is only capable on the T-Mobile network and it's other carriers such as Metro by t-mobile, mint mobile and many others. Thus, don't expect to get 5G on networks like AT&t, Verizon and their subsidiaries because, it will not happen.Oneplus decided to equip this phone with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 480 5G processor which is rated at 2.0 GHz per second. They also equipped the phone with 4 GB of RAM. The best way to describe the processing performance is steady and reliable. It is not the fastest processor in the world but, it will get the job done. After all, this is a $240 phone and not one of their $1,000 models. Frankly, you cannot expect flagship performance like you would get with the Snapdragon 865 chipset or the Snapdragon 888. Again, it is not the fastest processor in the world but, it is not the slowest by far. You will have absolutely no problems performing day-to-day tasks, streaming movies and even gaming to a degree. Moreover, the 90 Hertz screen refresh rate definitely compensates for a lot of this.Understand, I am reading this device for what it is and not based on what it's not. If you are looking for a reliable good looking smartphone and you don't want to pay a lot of money then this is really the device you want. I have used it for about a month now and I am very happy with it. I would definitely not hesitate to recommend it.",0

"I was in a pinch an didn't want to spend 800+ dollars on a new phone, this one seemed to tick all the boxes, 90hz screen, long battery life, external storage.BUT OnePlus cut a lot of corners with this device, my phone lags and bugs out/freezes because THEY DIDN'T GIVE IT ENOUGH RAM TO RUN MORE THAN ONE APP AT A TIME PLUS ITS OPERATING SYSTEM. You get 4gb of RAM and the phone uses roughly 3.5-3.7 GB of ram sitting idle.It takes 5+minutes for my phone to connect wired to Android Auto in my car because it doesnt have enough left over RAM to load it up. Sometimes it doesn't even work and I have to disconnect and reconnect the cable 3 times to get it to finally load, and when it does, it still takes a decent amount of time.APPS are broken a lot of the time. My banking app is unable to use its mobile deposit feature because the phone wont let it, despite me enabling permissions. my Google Fi app will just crash every single time, Youtube freezes when going to my subscription box/library.OnePlus, get your  act together, this is not a phone. I REGRET MY PURCHASE 100% the only good thing about this phone is battery life.",0
Great mobile,0
"I ordered this OnePlus Nord N200 | 5G unlocked android smartphone for myself because my current phone, a Motorola G7, (which I LOVE!), has gotten a little glitchy lately, especially when I'm trying to write and then post my Amazon reviews! And that's how I knew I finally needed to bite the bullet and replace my beloved Motorola G7!This is the unlocked U.S Version of OnePlus N200 5G. It measures 6.49"" long and nearly 3"" wide. It's about the same size as my G7, which I feel is a really nice size for a phone I use ALL the time! It has a very thin profile, which is very sleek. This is considered a ""budget""phone, much like my Motorola G7. Although I certainly do not consider a budget phone in any way other than price! This is a great, high quality phone, with amazing features!This phone has a full HD and LCD screen, with 90Hz smooth display. It has a large 5000mAh Battery with fast charging by either USB or Qi charger. It has 64GB of storage and a triple camera which I'm very excited to use for my Amazon reviews! The camera has ""Nightscape Capture"" which provides sharp and brilliant images, even in low light! Even though the vast majority of my pictures are for my Amazon reviews, it's really important to me to get really great high quality pictures for my reviews and I can't wait to see how this camera's quality will be reflected in my reviews!I guess I should mention that we have T-Mobile and this phone is compatible with T-Mobile.This phone has two really nice cameras. The rear facing camera is a triple camera and takes great pictures. It also has a 16 MP front facing ""selfie camera"". The ""ON"" button is on the side, and the ON button is also the side mounted fingerprint scanner. (Unfortunately, due to an autoimmune disorder that affects my fingers I cannot use fingerprint scanners) This camera has 4GB RAM and 64 GB storage. That's pretty typical for budget phones.This phone uses the Qualcomm Snapdragon 480 5G mobile platform. ""This is Qualcomm's latest 5G-capable processor and the first in its Snapdragon 4-series of chips. Qualcomm is the company that invented the breakthroughs that made 5G possible.5G is what enables the network that is designed to connect virtually everyone and everything together, including machines, objects, and devices."" This is huge for any budget Android phone! It takes it up a notch and puts your capabilities for gaming and streaming more in line with phones that cost far more. This platform ""takes a huge leap forward in mobile connectivity. The Snapdragon 5G system supports multiple 5G spectrums, modes, and frequencies—at lightning-fast speeds.""  It allows you to stream higher-quality movies, series, and games in more places at lightning fast  speeds."" You'll find this phone does not lag web playing have or streaming.This phone has something called warp charge. That allows you to get a full days charge in half an hour. That's not terribly impressive to me because my Motorola G7 is fully charged in 15 minutes and that charge lasts all day. That said, I'm not doing the gaming and streaming on my G7 that I'll be doing on my OnePlus Nord N200 5G. The OnePlus Nord N200 5G has a long-lasting 5000mAh battery.I'm a little concerned about the learning curve because most of my phone's have been Motorola phones and I haven't had any learning curve with these. But I'm sure, given a week or two it'll all seem very natural!  BTW, if you're going from any other Android phone and were using Google Photos, be sure to open Google Photos and sync all of your photos. You can continue to use Google Photos, or you can make the switch to the OnePlus photo app. The same is true for all of your other apps. Open Google on both phones, your new OnePlus and your old phone. You'll need to have both open to sync. Either leave your sim card in your old phone and Wait to transfer, or get a new sim card and proceed with all of the steps outlined in this review.Enjoy your new OnePlus Nord N200 5G phone! It's a beauty! And will bring you a wonderful experience for some time to come!Very highly recommended!",1
This phone is better than Apple in every way. The camera is better the speed is better and everything people who review this phone does NOT know what they are talking about. With my iPhone 11 pro Max I would get so many typos it was ridiculous but with this phone not so many typos only time I would get typos if I accidently pushed the wrong button cause my hands are too big. The camera is beautiful it's not slow at all I don't know what these other so called reviewers are talking about but from now on I'm gonna be in the one plus family for a long time. I only had this phone for a couple of days and it's doing well so far which I like other people on here expect more from a budget phone like why would you put high end stuff that you can only find with a thousand dollar phone and put it in a budget phone it's called a budget phone for a reason idiots. The battery holds up great for me and with all the reviews saying you can't add it to Sprint or Verizon network then don't cry and complain about it put it on another network and if you can't just buy another phone it's not that hard. When I get my paycheck again I'm gonna be buying the OnePlus 9 and I'll be back to reviewing another great phone HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!! (Edit)This phone is trash now they're aren't new updates it's stuck on Android 11 and will not update it's slow and just good never get a cheap phone from a major company there will always be flaws.,0
I am using it now and it fells smoother that me iphone 12 pro max. GET IT FOR THE PRICE.,1
"Battery is very good all day charge, apps work smooth and fast, 90 to 60 Ghz barely noticeable on this phone. Sound is kind of bad i can't use it.  Camera takes very nice pics on portrait mode  but video only at 30fps bad, very bad.  Good selfies,.  But  againVideo recording is a big disappointment.",1
I was skeptical at first. Now I see iphone pays influencers to enter their stupid opinions ... OnePlus nord 200 5g is an awesome buy! Works great on at&t ...,1
"My first 5G phone, works like a charm, fast, snappy, responsive. Better than any Galaxy phone I've owned, and I'm a Galaxy guy! Outstanding phone for the price.",1
"Being in I.T. I think it's important to use and be comfortable with other technology. I'm a die-hard Apple fanboy. But, I've been really impressed with this device. I like the available face unlock and fingerprint sensor. Both are incredibly fast. Using it for day-to-day task I prefer the larger screen over my iPhone 13 Pro.It is lacking IMHO to any Apple device as far as the ecosystem. But, if I was told I could only use an Android phone this would be a great place to start. The interfaces are smooth and quick to respond. Sometimes the face unlock is even a little too fast (I don't get to read the notifications on the lock screen before it unlocks with my face and dives into the home page).I've never used OnePlus devices before but I had a feeling it wouldn't disappoint.",1
"SO FAR IT'S GREAT , ONLY HAD IT 5 DAYS , JIM",0
I go,1
"I don’t usually write reviews but I will make an exception in this case. I bought this phone just before going out of the country and it initially worked well. 5 days after using this the internal storage memory was fully occupied primarily by the System and still continues to do while I am writing this review. Please refer to the photo along with my review. On looking up online, it looks like an issue with OnPlus phones and there is fix for this issue. I unfortunately do not have an option to return this phone as I am out of the country for a while and will have to buy a new non one plus phone while losing my money on this phone. Please do not buy this or any one plus phones until they sort this issue out.",1
I ordered Google Fi 5G SIM cards and put one in a google pixel 5 and a data only sim in a netgear nighthawk m5. With both of this devices I could hardly get a 5G signal. Mostly only a LTE signal. With the pixel I had to stand at the window to get the signal. Then I ordered the One Plus Nord 200 5G. With this phone I get a strong signal in my house and the hotspot feature works great.,1
"First  this phone is unlocked, as advertised.  Don't understand why someone said it wasn't unless they bought the wrong phone. Bought it for my son who is thrilled with it.  Put in sim from old phone and there it was, ready, just needed charging.  It works as well as my iphone.  Good midprice phone 5 G, which should last a good while.",0
"It's a decent phone if you want it for daily use. expect nothing special. The front camera is decent. The rear camera may give you a decent shot in good light but it is almost unusable in low light. The fingerprint sensor is decent. My past Xiaomi phone that I bought in 2018 had a better fingerprint reader and rear camera though. The build is really good, almost makes it feel premium. The software is good from Oneplus so no complaints about that. Overall it's a 3.5/5 IMO.",1
I am very happy with this phone. Highly recommend,0
The lack of complaining from my son due to his previous cell phone battery life has been heaven to my ears all for under $250 (with micro SD card and phone case). The only thing I would change is buying when I first saw it posted on Amazon.,0
"usually i don't write reviews, and i am not a phone person so this should be taken with a grain of salt.  I hate phones, and i believe smart phones are the worst invention because trying to get a phone to do a computers job is like asking a carriage to be faster than a car.  it doesn't make sense to me in any way shape or form.  however, this phone has blew my expectations.  I am speaking from a personal point as a person who thinks having a phone is a hassle(charging, and then making sure its set to networks, etc).  This phone surpasses my wildest expectations, and is a true 5G phone.  i don't take pictures much, but i will say for my use it does a good job.  The battery life is really long on this phone. I can usually go 2 days without charging(provided i don't use the pis suhone as much).  The connection  is superb and i am very happy",0

Loving the 5G service on cricket here in Hawai’i. 🤙🏾😊,0
"My only problem with this phone is the placement of the volume & power buttons.  I often take screen shots just because of how i grip my phone.  I put in an sd card to hold all my music, plenty of memory now.",0
I bought two of these as Christmas gifts and the two people are very happy with it. Good camera quality and clear microphone for calls. Video calls have a very clear image and sound. Battery life is also good. Price is right.,1
Nice phone!,0
"Facial recognition is a great feature, bluetooth connectivity to auto radio works well.",0
I bought two of these phones. The first one wouldn't  charge. The second  one turned  the RTT on and it won't go off. One plus is having  issues  with the RTT. They need to keep these out of America. They certainly  didn't do us a favor selling them here. Then to top it off Amazon customer service lied and told me the money  would  go to a gift card I couldn't  see it in my account. I have to get the phone  back from UPS. I would recommend not purchasing  a phone fom Amazon at all. The customer  service  agents don't UNDERSTAND ENGLISH!!!,1
I use almost nothing but OnePlus devices like their watch and airbuds and have had previous phones with them as well so i was excited to see that they have a cheaper alternative phone out. At first it was ok but very quickly i began to experience the flaws the phone had. It's slow like laughable slow. I once had to restart it and took 5mins to come back on? I will get texts and Facebook messages notifications minutes and even up to hours after they were sent to me. I will be on one app then get on a other for 1minute then go back to the other page and it has to reload or even restart like I'm just loging into the app for the first time. Terrible phone and honestly don't recommend it which is sad for this company which is usually been so good at everything they touch!,1
"I've been using One plus phones since their very first model back when they used their lottery/invite system. Since then, I e only had a phone from them. That being said, this is possibly the worst model they've produced. Granted, it's priced very affordably, but the OS for this model makes the phone unusable sometimes. Battery life is good, camera is decent, and graphics are good. However, the sheer aggressiveness of the underlying battery saving system software means that every app you open gets closed in the background. What this means is that if you swap between apps, its likely that the background app will get closed and forced to restart when you switch back. When working on multiple things or even just switching between a browser and an app, you become very frustrated quickly. It's highly likely I'll be getting rid of this phone and getting a different model.",0
"Seems like a decent phone, if I could find a cheap mvno that supports it. H2O does not, so I suspect that none of the AT&T mvno's will.Edit: I did eventually get the phone to connect to h2o. I tried tinkering with the network settings for days, then it suddenly started working. I assume h2o fixed it on their end.",1
"El teléfono es una excelente opción cuando buscas una relación precio calidad, está excelente para el precio, el lector de huellas lo tiene en el botón de encendido, tiene reconocimiento facial para desbloquear, la batería dura bastante tiempo con el teléfono en uso constante, la calidad de imagen de la pantalla es muy buena y el teléfono es 5G! Los contras son la cámara en general no es la mejor, no tiene un botón para poner el celular en vibración. Es general me gusta!",1
All good,0
"Phone is snappy in menus but slows down when starting and ending calls, this includes whatsapp or messenger calls.  It seems when connecting any type of call the added network load is a bit too much for the processing units. Other than this very minor annoyance, One+ seem to think It's OK for them to not allow you to turn their own advertisement and app notifications, so basically you can turn off any other app notifications except the One+ apps.Phone was purchased for a pre-teen and the quality, speed, battery life to price ratio is great. Overall it's a quality device and does exactly what we needed it to do.  We are able to overlook the annoyances.",0
"Seems great so far. New 5G tower about 100 feet from the house so it always getting 5 bars now. It's heavy but the price for a mega sized battery. Seems snappy and responds well. I am not a power user of smart phones but of computers so if i can run a few apps that are not games and it does it well, I am happy. I am happy. The display is gorgeous and the camera is good but not if you think you are some auteur. I am using it with Mint mobile and the two have a very low cost of ownership.",1
"Like always, blu, is a great móvil.....thanks",1
I now own two of these phones,0
"Perfect budget phone. Do not expect flagship features. I use iPhone 12 Pro Max and got this to have a second device as I need Android for work.Unlocking the screen is not the fastest. Face recognition doesn't work with glasses on, fingerprint is located on the side button(power button) I found it tricky cause i wake up the screen with double tap. Fingerprint reader works however not the best. Camera also is not satisfying, especially at night. But remember this is budget phone, and for this price i think it is pretty good deal. I will keep it.",1

"This is a Super Nice phone. These phones are (NOT) locked to T-Moblile. My carrier is AT&T. It has an advanced technology, operating system, function, and the fingerprint reader works better than any phone I've had. Having said that, it's very easy to setup. I have AT&T as my carrier, I just swaped the sim card from my old phone and it was ready to setup. Keep in mind this phone does have a Setup Wizard which guides you throught the process. It does have a slot for expandable memory. The technology of this phone works great, I have a pair of Raycon E55 earbuds that have the new 5.0 bluetooth technology (stereo sound) and they sounded awesome on my previous phone but they sound even better on this new N200 5G. I was conflicted between buying the N200 5G and N10 5G, both are very similar but personally I think the N200 5G is the better model. Do yourself a favor and spend an extra few dollars to buy the suggested phone protection case with a black surround. This phone is worth protecting the cameras on the back, against shock if dropped, and it will keep the phone from sliding around as it is very lightweight (but very good quality) and has a slick surface. I can't say enough about how impressive this phone is. Buy it!!!",0
"I have always been an iPhone user, unfortunately my iPhone 11 stops working. In a rush to find a new phone  I give the chance to One Plus after checking many reviews. The phone appearance and interface is very friendly and easy to use. Even thought the phone have 3 cameras is difficult to get a fast shot.My trading apps runs smooth, also my games with the gaming mode runs like amazing!The fingerprint recognized fast the finger it remind me the old iPhone versions.I can say that the best feature of this phone is the battery it can last days among the the fast charging.If you find  yourself in a situation of a rush for a phone this is definitely your best option of the market.",1
i like this phone - i havent use the camera yet - easy to use-loud speaker thats big plus for me -fast responses- very good screen quility - a gaming button feature- more features than i would use. and the price is right. i just cant see spending big bucks on a phone when they all  basically do the same thing. oh and also works with mint mobile service,0
"Good phone for cheap price, works well, good quality phone, well built and sturdy phone.Software needs improvement, fingerprint reader does not always work, can't double tap phone to show time like phone instructions say, instead it goes into pocket mode where it asks you to touch certain area of phone to wake it up!!!!! Freezes alot, but then fixes itself and starts working again.All in all you get what you pay for, definitely not Samsung quality software, but good phone for price, does what it needs to, but scetchy software.",1
Love this phone,0
"I am a multi phone user. When it came to investing in a phone for work I did my research and looked for the most middle middle performing phone out there. This was it. It has performed above expectations without overachieving and does not compete with my higher end flagships. But as a solid phone with the ability to get some mileage out of it for the cost, the battery and okay performance this phone is good.",0
Yes works on straight talk but u have to buy the Sims card pack,1
As I learn the ins-n-outs finding lots of new features from my previous phone.,1
