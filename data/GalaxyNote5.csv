"To say i am a samsung fan since 7 years. I was using samsubg galaxy s9plus.  Wanted to upgrade to a samsung note series. Was wondering if u should go for note 20 plus or note 10 plus.

After using it for 2 weeks, I realise no one will need more than this for what is expected from a note series. Paying more tha...READ MORE",1

"Having used OnePlus and iPhone in the past, and having steered clear of Samsung because of their software, the Note 10+ plus has come as a surprise. I don't llay games on my phone so every day performance is just super smooth, without any hiccups. The phone is monstrous to hold and have in your pocket (I have dropped it 3 times in 2 weeks). I still don't like the look and feel of the Samsung One UI. Settings are horrible at best and what you are looking for is never found at the right place. ...READ MORE",1
I have been a Galaxy Note user for past 3 generations and I just love the device. The display will take you breath away as it is huge yet beautifully crafted. It doesn't feel big in your hand and the curved display adds an extra omph to it. It's a premium device to hold in your hands. The camera has been really good. Apart from some noise in low light I didn't feel any other problem. I'm hoping the depth sensor performance would get better with future update as there as some glitches in liv...READ MORE,1

"The Note 10+ has been an absolute revelation in terms of performance and display quality. The edge to edge display is vivid, crisp and very readable even in bright sunlight.
