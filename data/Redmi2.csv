"I am giving it 5 stars because it is the best ever smartphone in this price range. Just 1 drawback is it gets warm very quick and too much but it is bearable and it can be fixed via update. Although, Xiaomi has fixed this issue to about 20% in their latest MiUi 13.0.5.0 update. You can buy this phone without thinking for 1 second.READ MORE",1
