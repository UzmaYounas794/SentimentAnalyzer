"This is Great phone build wise, looks premium in hand, but if you compare specification of this phone with chinese brand then you will get dissponted, this phone is from different league.

"Got it at 10.9k with exchange discount.People who are criticizing this phone are going by specs. In real world usage, screen is very nice despite being HD+ (viewing angles arent good though) and performance is super-smooth (for daily usage apps like Whatsapp, email, browsing and Youtube, havent tried gaming yet) . If clean android, good looks and good performance is what you need, go for it. Camera and screen are average (no pixellation despire HD+ resolution)READ MORE",1

Camera: Primary camera is superb. Photos taken are very natural looking with out any artificial color or brightness boost. Amazed by the quality of images.
