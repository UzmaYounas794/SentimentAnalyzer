Reviews,Verdict
"Was so confused when my eight year old Asus turned slow as a sloth and started looking for a good laptop that fits my needs. I'm a regular laptop user - no gaming, photo or video editing or other graphic-heavy tasks.My uses were regular browsing, media consumption and productivity uses. I had shortlisted the Lenevo Ideapad 5, Dell Inspiron 15 series, and Asus Vivobook K15 OLED along with this MI Notebook Ultra. As I was not the one who doesn't go after brand value per se, (Not a Maruti Suzuki/Hero Honda fan, OnePlus over Samsung) the brand value of Dell wasn't a factor in my decision making, but the after sales service was. The MI Notebook Ultra isn't cheaper either as you could get the Dell model with similar specs at almost the same price.Finally I choose to go with the MI Notebook Ultra as I felt all other laptops have inferior display except the Asus K15 OLED. We all are spoilt by the amazing high quality super Amoled displays with high refresh rates, I was sure I would get affected by the inferior displays of other models mentioned here and can affect my media consumption experience a lot. Other factors that made me choose this one over others is the build quality of this one which feels pretty solid as it has an all-metal body while all others in the list has plastic elements in it which feels cheap and fragile.Things that can be adversely affect your decision to buy this one - MI is relatively new to the market and doesn't have much experience in building laptops.MI phones brand recognition is often associated with its crappy UI and phones filled with bloatwares, but I can assure that here, it does not matter as laptop comes pre-installed with clean Windows OS.Regarding the thermals, I've observed that the laptop tends to heat a little bit when it is being charged and used at the same time.Suggestions for improvement - Lack of privacy shutter for the front camera. I feel it is a huge deal since we can often forget to turn off the video during online meetings and this an effective tool to make sure you're not seen.Lack of AMD Ryzen variants - Gone are days where Intel used to dominate the chip market since now Ryzen variants offer better performance than the similar Intel variants. I'd have happily hone with the Ryzen 5 5500u variant instead of the i5 11 variant if it was made available.Front camera should've been betterProspective buyers please keep in mind that the RAM is soldered and cannot be upgraded so try to get the 16 GB variant of your use case demands high RAM requirements.",0
"Looks great, super display and  quite fast so far.Big disspointment is the charger and charging. It has the ugliest legacy looking charger i have seen in recent times.. and no we can't use any usb type c charger to charge the laptop. This is a real bummer, the thunderbolt port also doesny charge the laptop.The webcam and the speakers are also totally useless. So a video call was a disspointing experience.And the free office for home and student didn't get activated for me. All mi support could do was redirect me to a youtube video and microsoft directly. I wasn't able to work around the error msg: office home and student is not associated to your account. Hope it works for others.Happy with the build quality, display, wifi 6 and fast ports.Rest all is just gimick unless some miraculous software update can fix the speakers, webcam and charging options.",0
"This is the first time i am writing a review for a product that I'm using past 6months. am usually very choosy when it comes to finding right product. This laptop is chosen after a lot of research. Found really good when compared with laptops of other companies in the same price range. Totally happy with the display quality & build quality. Graphic intensive games might not like best in this range, but believe me in this price you won't get this level screen quality & build quality. forget about this level you won't get half of this level build quality.",1
"I managed to get the 16G i7 variant. I have been using laptop as daily driver. It's a good laptop but just a little workload gets the fan buzzing. Camera is trash and so can be said about audio. I have faced already power on issues 2-3 times in just 6 months. I will check if that issue happens again to report the issue (but as the issue is not persistent, when you report it's possible that it boot up every time during report and testing). Extended warrant plans on Amazon or in mi store is from Onsite Go or One Assist (one assist has bad customer reviews and in substantial numbers)Meanwhile, I got a chance to work on Macbook Air 2020 8G RAM 256 G ssd and it feels much smoother and audio quality is much much louder than Mi notebook and price around 79K-80K during offer period (camera is marginally better than Mi but not great in base macbook air which I used)",1
"Â Laptop is working on its own after enabling touchpad seems some internal issue in laptop as updated the drivers restarted many times but the problem is still the same.Considering the costing of the Laptop material is cheap and boot ime is more than expected the only good thing found till now is the sound of the laptop is good no complains on that. Delivery was also super fast by Amazon.Now raising the touchpad issue with Amazon lets see what happens.Will update accordingly.Update on 29th Jan Laptop replacement request taken by Amazon and new laptop is arriving tomorrow.But this seems some scam as the brand new seal packed laptop is a used one as you can see the laptop browser is already configured with some gmail id tojikdominic@gmail.com which is syncing the browser data payment methods cards and passwords.Kind Attension Please have these checked before you start using the laptop for any online purchase or before saving your password on the personal computer.Pathetic experience on return request for the product, Delivery & pickup service vendor of Amazon isn't trust worthy for such big amount purchases.Followedup for about 15 Days and many hours on their customer support to get my refund.",1
"Received the laptop with CHARGER. Good qualti at first impression and good speed so far. Two things I found could be better was, Brightness of the laptop is not high + speakers could be little more loud.I feel both as to be 80% of what they should be.",1
"I got my laptop delivered today from Amazon. As I was looking for an extended warranty, I called mi.com and was asked to call oneassist to get the warranty. They offered extended two years warranty at 6499 while the same plan if purchased from mi.com along with the laptop is 3699.  I called mi customer care and the reason given was since you have purchased from Amazon, our partners can't provide you at the same rate and you should have bought from mi.com. Why is this not mentioned in Amazon or mi website as a disclaimer. I felt really cheated and this is not what I expected from Amazon nor Xiaomi.Updating after using for three months. Motherboard problem in three months. Can you imagine. The c c type charging port was not working and had given to an authorised service centre. It's been three weeks and no one called back after checking the issue. When I called they are saying motherhood issue and they have ordered the part and the company is not sending the part. They asked us to call and order the part. Pls don't buy MI PRODUCT. They don't provide good service nor extented warranty. Deeply regret for investing in this product",1
"We'll crafted, light weight laptop with top notch internals. Value for money at this price range compared to other exclusive laptop brands .",1
"When the laptop is connected to charging point and I am not doing anything on the laptop, some process gets stuck (like edge) and CPU utilization goes high & the FAN starts making noise.if i disconnect the Charger then the problem goes away, another option is to go and kill the hanged application/process.I went to the service centre they did a software reinstall but its still not solved.Now i really want to return this fault product but as per amazon policy u can not return after 10 days, I am using this laptop for 45 days approx.  i am really not sure if mi can fix the issue ( or first identify ).i can foresee myself knocking the service Center door more often now.",1
"Balanced Battery Upto 5-6 Hours easily.Good WebcamSmooth PerformanceNot for GamingEveryday tasks like video editing,streaming Content can easily be achieved.",1
The speaker quality is worst. Even my normal phone speaker is higher volume than this. If the ceiling fan is running You will have to struggle to hear anything. And Amazon wont even take a return order.,1
"Purchased this 15 days ago, Was extremely happy for first 7 days - excellent performance.But Screen has already started flickering. Battery backup is poor, camera/sound are extremely disappointing.Not going to recommend this.  Never buying MI again.",1
"Except for poor speakers everything else is awesome. I mainly use this to develop android and full stack apps and this machine is a beast for my workflow. So , I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a new laptop.",1
"The laptop initially had heating issues. Gave it to the service center where the heat sink was replaced as it was defective. Then I started to face backlight screen bleeding issues. The engineers at the service center told me that it's how the laptop is manufactured. Utter crap! And now I'm facing issues with the bluetooth. Again gave it to the service center where a wifi-bluetooth card needs to be replaced. I mean what is going on. A brand new laptop worth Rs. 64,000/- and I'm already facing so many issues. A huge waste of money and peace. I'm pretty sure my unit is defective and everytime Xiaomi replaces the defective part and gives it back to me. I mean imagine that feeling you get of buying a new laptop just to repair it multiple times and use it. The laptop has spent more time in the service center than with me. Pretty sad situation!",0
One day it just stopped working,1
"Its pretty solid machine, so far its too good and value for money. Fingerprint is so fast display is too good.Spearker volume is not up to the mark",1
Â It is dead in2day,1
"Â unable to boot. On/off is going, seems Os crashed",0
Am giving 3 start due to laptop experiencing little bit shock while charging. Remaing all are good for meCharger quality need to improve,1
"No slim book with 16 GB ram, 3.2k display and an aluminum chassis at this price. Would have loved the ryzen variants that were launched in China to be launched here but either way it's still a steal for a deal like this. The only issue is if they provided another fan, instead of a single fan system would have been good cuz I live in a very hot area. The temps go high as 98Â° for 1-2 seconds during a very high load and then goes down at 75Â° immediately after the fan kicks in. Noise of the fan is not noticeable even at high speed. Overall a bank for the buck. Now the only thing left is after sale service and how long this last before its first breakdown.Low sound in speakers can be fixed by selecting gaming mode in dts app coming preinstalled with the laptop.",1
Please don't buy this product .Pros:Nice screenSlimMac book feel16GB i7 is superfastCons:Build feels poor in the bottom.The grill vent in the bottom is very poor and can bend even with mild press.Speakers sound is lowSpeakers get blocked on soft surfaces and you don't hear anything.Battery performance is 30 percent less than what they claim on website.After One month..The laptop is NOMORE running on the battery.It gets turned off when I remove charger. I should take to it service center now and feel ashamed for buying such poor product.Please buy a better one.,1
"Bought the Mi Ultra laptop during the first sale on 31st Aug. Extremely disappointed with the laptop as well as Mi Support.12/09: Laptop doesn't turn on anymore. It has been 10 days, so cannot even return it. On the 6th day, the laptop went into a continuous restart loop which I fixed with hard shut down 3 times after watching some YouTube videos. And then it was working okay for 2 days. Now it doesn't even start. The charge light also doesn't come on. Nothing happens on pressing the power button. Nothing happens when you connect the charger. It's dead. Need to take it to the service center just 10 days into the purchase! Don't buy this, all the great specs are useless if it doesn't start!Update 13/09: I gave it for service and they are saying the battery and motherboard is defective and they need to replace it! I'm shocked. It's a brand new laptop and in 10 days the battery and motherboard is gone? How can that happen? I've hardly even used it! And they also say that since it's a new laptop the parts are taking time to come to the service center! Better to buy a reliable HP, Dell, Lenovo laptop even if it's a bit more expensive!Update 20/09: It has been with Mi service center for 8 days now. Everytime I call them they say it will get fixed in 2 days. On probing further they said there is a hardware problem. The battery and motherboard needs to be replaced! Wow I can't understand how the battery and motherboard can have problems in just 10 days of purchase? It's clearly a manufacturing defect from Xiaomi. They say they have ordered the parts but they haven't received it since it's a new model! Unbelievable!Just lost lot of money and peace with this laptop! Don't trust Xiaomi from now.23/09: They called me from the service center and asked me to collect a replacement laptop. I got a brand new laptop unopened and I opened it and checked in the service center itself. It seems that they couldn't fix the old laptop and had to send it back, so I got lucky. Else, I would have got a repaired one.Anyway, I'm happy I got a new replacement laptop and currently it's working well.",1
This laptop is for productivity based people. Decent for gaming but not for gamers. Display quality is just amazing to watch videos. Having highest resolution has created compatibility issues with few softwares.Light in weight. Easy carrying but the only and biggest con is the sound quality. 2W sound is absolutely not enough. Mobiles have high sound than this laptop. You may have to connect to additional device like bluetooth speaker to compensate that sound and quality. Apart from that this is one of the best if not the best laptops within the range for productivity purpose.,1
"I am writing this review after 3 month of use.Boots up quickly, finger print is quick.Screen is awesome bright crisp & clear.Performance was a good part of this laptop with good key quality.windows 11 upgrade is free along with MS office student lifetime free accesssolid build with aluminium alloy frame.Battery last longer no heating issue so farOnly thing disappoints is 3rd party sourced charger not an Xiaomi charger on box",1
"Overall product is good, but charger is missing in package, and web cam is very bad quality",1
"I bought around a month back and writing my review based on my daily usage of 2-3 hours.Also, I have MacBook Air 2015 edition and comparing few aspects with it.Pros:1. Fast boot2. No heating issue even after using for 2-3 hrs3. Finger sensor is working good4. Good Battery life5. Aluminium bodyCons:1. Few keys like ""Shift"", ""arrow keys"", ""Home"", ""End"", ""Pgup"", ""PgDn"" keys are not correctly placed in Keyboard. Need some practise to use new KB layout.2. Mouse trackpad is not so sensitive as the MacBook one.3. Sleep mode option is consuming some battery.4. Buy from MI website as they offer few additional offers like Extended warranty, Insurance, additional cashback",1
Â It keeps crashing randomly.,1
"I received the product on 17-Oct-2021, setup the user account in Windows, within 3 hours, the entire display got pixelated & system was not responding. The same problem happened again on 24-Oct-2021.Waste of Money.Waste of Time.",0
"Speaker is too low and week. you simply cant here anything, less than mobile sound. i dont know what stops xiaomi to add good speaker to this device?... Xiaomi should give me bluetooth speaker FREE.",1

"Got it delivered today, the build quality is great, display is amazing. Performance is also good.Only disappoinment is with sound. It is very low, even ur mobile sound could be louder then this. Xiaomi should definitely work on this.",0
"Pehli baat to is laptop ko buy karna hi Mahabharat hai.Not available anywhere in NCR region i5/16gb. Just imagine not available in capital city!!Luckily i got from Amazon which took 8 days to deliver since it wasn't on stock.About the laptop its beauty!! hats off to Xiaomi for this. As RAM is not upgradable, never buy 8gb version.",0
"When i was setting it up..and installing windows updates it crashed two times and rebooted,after then windows Hello sign in feature was disabled automatically, fingerprint was working fine for first five days and then it showed error Message as this feature is unavailable..Raised a replacement request with Amazon and thank to supportive staff they barely took 15 min to create a replacement order thanks Amazon.I i bought mi notebook ultra i7 varient.Apart from this software bug laptop is really awesome..it has this flagship display. Build quality is awesome too.. battery life was decent for my working (around 7-8 hours) over all for 68k it was a steal deal for me..",1
"okay got the ultra today and the display is not as amazing as advertised imho. It is extremely sharp (thanks to the 2000p display!) but not at all color accurate. So over saturated that it gives mi and realme phone camera vibes lol. Another example after the iPhone 11 that proves higher resolution != better display.I have an old hp pavilion 14 x360 (14inch 1080p), LG 22MK600M monitor (22 inch IPS LCD 1080p), Lenovo L24i-30 monitor (24 inch IPS LCD 1080p) to compare with and have to say color reproduction is not at all natural on the Mi laptop. And yeah it is the worst of the 4 with Lenovo at 3rd HP 2nd and LG the best. I tested with the famous costa rica 4k video and the greens and yellows on the snake at 0: 07 are so so poor that it almost feels like one bright green. Even looking at the long shots of the trees you can tell the display is so over saturated. Especially looking side by side with others, the differences could easily be spotted (tbh there's no need to look side by side either. you can tell easily, unless you're coming from a TN panel).However everything else about the laptop is great (would've loved ryzen but it's okay considering intel iris xe). 16GB ram with i5 is a combination most tasks find useful but rarely available. Quality of life features like Battery life, thunderbolt, type-c charging, fp scanner, large track-pad and better than average keyboard (I'm used to mechanical so can't appreciate much). Restart takes like 15sec max. wake up from sleep is instant. excellent build (although my hp x360 is good too, so it's not as 'awe'ing to me). the hinge is so satisfying. It's all top notch. Only display didn't reach the expectation.",1
"It has got a great built and macbook like looks.Excellent weight distribution but kind of slippery.I experienced a screen flickering issue on the last day of return period. The laptop flickered & got frozen, nothing worked after that. I restarted it worked again & then after 15 minutes on Ms Word same thing happened. Nothing was visible during this issue black and white horizontal lines and laptop wasn't responsive. I fortunately got it returned & refunded.Cheap quality charger, heats up a lot with little use.Xiaomi needs to be more reliable in laptop section. Too much cost cutting spoils the whole thing.",1
"Please do not buy this brand laptop. I bought it on 16 March. After 3 months of using it, i can definitely say it is not worth buying. I have i5 11th gen 16gb 512gb varient. Still it hangs sometime even when i am not using internet on it. While watching videos, it hangs sometimes. And now it's screen is not working properly. The quality of screen was good but now it is not working all black. WTF. Only 3 month working screen. Now I have to go back and forth to mi center to claim warranty. I don't have time for that. Even most of you too.Always buy laptop from the brand who have name in their field. They are new and giving nothing right now.",1
Everything awesome about the laptop. It gives definite mac feeling except the logo. But the battery does not sustain atleast more than 3 hours with normal usage.,1
"Speakers are too worst that you will feel to buy a 20 k basic laptop instead of wasting huge amount on this.Seeing issue in Bluetooth, getting crack soundTouch pad is not so well.Only build is elligent and screen is good..other than that i don't see much use in this.initiated return after 1 hour of unboxing this laptop, but even to returning is not that easy,it's been two days am following up ..mi customer service is too worst please don't even expect that they will respond to you, they said you bought from Amazon we can't even take any complaints.and when spoke with Amazon they said they will send the technician then only return will be approved, even technician dint come instead he asked to record and send in watsapp.finally Amazon helped me in validating with speaker issue and now initiated the return.",1
"Â My experience after using laptop after 15 days. After 10 days using Mi notebook ultra, unfortunately my laptop screen starts flickering. I went to service centre.They told me that they are not servicing laptop and asked me to go to other centre. I raised my complaint through tollfree number. Without any intimation they closed the complaint and I left without any solution till now.",1
Â The laptop is extremely well builtI have i5 8gb variant as 16 gb was out of stock.1) performance is great for this price range is great2) battery life is also good for an instance i started at 9 in the morning at 100% and it lasted for 2 pm.In meanwhile i was continuously using it at 90hz 3 tabs were open in chrome and it was connected to wifi and Bluetooth display brightness was 50% as i was indoor.3) Gaming I don't do heavy gaming but i played valorant on it at 1080p  low graphics and it was giving around 50 to 80 fps . maybe 16 gb varient will give 60 to 90%.4) Charging while using it takes around 3 hours.5) speakers are a little bit low but i didn't faced any problem as i always use earphones or headphones.6) heating i didn't faced any major heating issue.I tried 4k video rendering and valorant but the temperature never exceeded 80Â°C . As i am coming from acer Predator it was really good because in Predator temperature is around 95+ while gaming or editing.But after two days when i was doing a typing test its tab key poped out of keyboard.So immediately contact Amazon and hopefully they raised an return.This time i will wait for 16gb.,0
Opened my laptop first time instantly noticed dead pixels all over the laptop disappointed,1

"The Laptop is the best in the price range.Pros- Performance, Build Quality, Display, Battery, TrackpadCons- Keyboard a little Flimsy with a little flexThe sound problem can be resolved by playing with the DTS Control Panel.",0
"Been using it few days now, it's fast, gets most of the things done. For this price range, I think it's worth it.",1
"Disappointed,Within a time of 1 month or so issues I faced are :* Battery Backup (Used to be about 4 to 6 hours, now I get 2 - 3 hours)* Screen Flickering Issue as in the pic attached.* Random Lines appear on the display sometimes.I can't even get the Mi Support in my area,I request the seller to please help me out.",1
Â Quality of the laptop is very pathetic.Because of bad quality it stopped working even before 2 months.I gave it for service and they are not ready to replace with new one.It's motherboard got damaged. MI told they will replace it. I will update after that. Whether it is working or not.On 18th may i received the laptop but still it's having problem. Now MI service center saying display issue. Need to replace display.I will updateUpdate Jun 7/2022: I received the laptop after repair. Initially they didn't change the mother board. Now only mother board replaced. I don't think that it will last even for 1 year. so extended the warranty for 3 years after spending 3500rs.My verdict: Don't buy this crap. Buy only from other established brands,0
"I was confused between this laptop and some models of MSI. My requirements were very clear - good processor, decent amount of RAM, Light weight laptop, wanted really good battery life (because I travel a lot), something that doesn't gets too much heated.So I chose this Laptop after reading all those reviews on the product, after using it for 3 weeks I can tell it fulfilled only a few of mine requirements.1. Laptop is lighter than other normal laptops2. Processor is decent3. Screen is pretty goodthat's it.Now some of the things that you should be aware about this laptop:1. It gets heated too badly. I'm not even playing games man. Just a bunch of Chrome Tabs with Youtube playing songs in one and other normal surfing. And it's overheating so much.2. I read other reviews that Speakers are crappy - but I thought it might have little less volume than other laptops. And as I mostly use my headphones while working. But man the speakers of this laptop are really crappy. My friend came, I wanted to show hima quick YouTube video and we could barely hear anyhting coming from the laptop. The sound is that bad. My 4 year old phone has got better speaker than this pice of shite.3. Programs are abruptly ending sometime - it just crashes for no reasons. I have never seen anything like that in ages. I paid so much money for this laptop which can hardly run decent size softwares.4. Battery life was very important to me, and as other reviews said 6-7 hours of usage time on this machine, I believed it to be true. But it hardly works for 2-3 hours.Also, the charging speed is very slow.These are the things that make me puke on this device. It took me 2-3 weeks to figure out that I've not spent my 65k but burnt my hard-earned 65k. Should have waited some time to buy Mac Air 2020.  But i made a huge mistake.",1

"It's an almost perfect laptop with three things I would have liked to call a perfect one. Camera quality, Speaker and rather than 3.2K they could have gone for 4K resolution. The camera is okay but could have been better. Speaker is below average in terms of quality as well as loudness. Other than these Xiaomi has pulled a masterstroke here and the future laptops may get even better.",1

"Was so confused when my eight year old Asus turned slow as a sloth and started looking for a good laptop that fits my needs. I'm a regular laptop user - no gaming, photo or video editing or other graphic-heavy tasks.My uses were regular browsing, media consumption and productivity uses.

I feel it is a huge deal since we can often forget to turn off the video during online meetings and this an effective tool to make sure you're not seen.Lack of AMD Ryzen variants - Gone are days where Intel used to dominate the chip market since now Ryzen variants offer better performance than the similar Intel variants. I'd have happily hone with the Ryzen 5 5500u variant instead of the i5 11 variant if it was made available.Front camera should've been betterProspective buyers please keep in mind that the RAM is soldered and cannot be upgraded so try to get the 16 GB variant of your use case demands high RAM requirements.",1
"ohk so first of all.pros:-1.great display2.keyboard is very tactile and nice3.finger print scanner is just awesome4: overall no performance issues5.build quality is just great.i mean its just top of the line.1.79 kg umm you can't say it's light but yeah it's not that 3-4lg like those damnn gaming laptops ð. it's quite slim.easily can be opened by one hand and let me tell u it helps a lot atleast you don't have to pur your coffee mug down to open the laptop ð.(fyi guys:-i bought the i5 16 gb variant)you also must go 16 gb if you want to use it for like more than 2 years.cons:-1.trackpad quality is little disappointing imean it's great,but it's just that it fells a little how can i say that luke mushy or something like that you have to get used to it.2.heat yup let me tell you heat issues are there like even if u have a 16 gb variant and u are running like just 3-4 applications  it will get like more warmer than usuall.like on the f2-f3 keys and above section.so yeah you can expect more heating while doing extensive tasks.like video rendering or slight gaming.3.i don't know if this happened with me only or it was a bug but while set up i was facing a white screen issue after logging in my microsoft account.i had to re-start the laptop like couple of times,then the setup got completed.4.speakers those damnnn speakers.bc mera phone jyada tez sound krta hai un speakers se.i would recommend to get a mini Bluetooth speaker for content consumption.i download a app called audio relay,so it let me use my phone's speaker as a wireless speaker.ohk so that was all form my side",1

"Hi everyone just got my laptop from amazon yesterday @55K! (hdfc sale). Installed NFS underground, far cry 2, working smooth like a charm. 16gb rams is super fast and installation is faster than even desktop. Best part is its 4K screen and superb battery. Full charge in less than an hour, and backup for 6hrs in heavy use....u can stretch it more with reduced brightness and battery saver. Very sleek and handy, miss the num pad though. guys, i can understand that sound is a little low, but you workaround it. Go to DTS settings and turn up the equalizer (all buttons to full). This is increase at least 20% sound",1
"I bought this on 8th Sep. The laptop is good and definitely value for money.But there was no Mi extended warranty option when you buy from Amazon. I wrote to Amazon and the response was to contact in case I do not get any response by 17th. But on 18th the option of chat contact was also closed (return window closed on 17th, - I did not understand the connection as the question is not about return)nor did I get any response through email.  It is cheating as you pay the same price for curtailed benefits but you are not told of this upfront. This leaves bad tase in the whole buying experience. For the first time I am unhappy with both Amazon and Xiaomi.",1
"ProsGreat price to value proposition. Similar spec laptops cost twice as much from established brands.Beautiful 15.6 inch anti glare 16:10 aspect ratio matte screen. 16:10 ratio helps to see more lines in excel/word documents compared to 16:9 aspect ratio. But 16:9 seems more suited for viewing videos since no horizontal black bars at the top and bottom of screen.Elegant looks in full metallic body. Grey colour variant looks stunning. Like an affordable windows macbook. Solid built with no flex in the laptop body.Thunderbolt 4 port for versatile connectivity. Connect 2 4k monitors simultaneously from same thunderbolt port. Thunderbolt is exclusive to 11th gen Intel core i5/i7 and not available yet in AMD ryzen 7 series processors.Charge through either thunderbolt port or type c portMacro key which can be used to quick launch an app like chrome by drag and drop of app into the macro key input area.Battery charge indicator with 3 colours. Red for  charge less than 20, orange from 20 to 90 and green for charge more than 90 percentage.90hz display with 3k resolution. Scrolling very smooth. fn+s key to switch between 60hz and 90hz refresh rateCore i7 11th gen processor - breeze through normal workloads. Haven't heard the cooling fans kicking in yet.512gb nvme ssd for speedy launch of programming ide like pycharm.16gb ram - most of the time 8 gb freeIntel iris graphics - haven't tried any games yet but 4k YouTube videos are smooth.Wifi 6 and Bluetooth 5.1 for reliable connectivity.65w usb type c charger - full charge in 90 mins.Can use 65w mobile phone charger to charge this laptop.Fingerprint sensor and power button combined.Good loud speakers after enabling games mode on inbuilt dts app and turning on Equalizer.Lifetime validity Office 2019 included - get ready to work on excel Power point etc without spending additional for Microsoft office software. Activation also easy by giving personal email while launcing office app first time.Soft relatively silent keys with good travel and 2 levels of backlight for working at night. Comfortable to type for long.Usable 720p camera for zoom/teams call. Disable digital video stabilization setting from camera app else there will be delay in video.Close to 10 hour battery backup after full charge. Battery drain also reasonable under normal workloads. Battery stand by good.Large trackpad which is good and supports gestures like gentle single tap for left click, gentle tap with 2 fingers together for double click which removes need for press/click of trackpad. Configure touchpad options for better results.Good palm rejection and comfortable edges while typing on keyboard.Hinge closes in a smooth pleasant manner with enough cushioningHassle free exchange by Amazon for 7 year old base model macbook air.No cost emi for 3 monthsWhat could have been improved to make this laptop even better:Mi 67w sonic charger which has a slim profile should have been provided instead of the rather  uninspiring default legacy kind of looking LITEON company charger.Small size of shift key on right takes time to get used to. Could have been a normal size shift key.No dedicated sd card slot to quickly transfer photos from SLR to laptop. Have to rely on usb cables.No dedicated number keys even though laptop is a 15.6 inch one. Would have been better to have dedicated number keys while working on excel.Voice capture using inbuilt microphone not the loudest. Use a wired or wireless headphone for voice capture.A bit on heavier side while picking up.May be due to the grade 6 sandblasted aluminium used.Backlight doesn't stay on. Goes off after sometime of inactivity and has to be renabled. But it seems there is an option in bios to keep it on the whole time once selected.Default sound output from speakers not loud enough. Only once games mode is selected and equalizer is enabled from inbuilt dts app does the sound output cross 80 decibel.",1
"Â Pros 1. Good quality screen2. keypad ig good with backlit lights3. Sleek design4. Processor runs fastCons.1. Trackpad is very bad, very hard to press2.Sound is very very low almost 40% of my S20 Phone",1
"Everything is fine i doesn't like 3 things in it they are1) Touch Pad is Not up to the mark it's not giving any premium feel and not nice.2) 2Ã2W Speakers are very low.3) Charger inside the box is not the Xiaomi branded Charger they are giving other company charger named ""LITEON"" Brand.Rest of that everything is fine",0
The after sales support is not available as the login with fingerprint is not working,1
"Definitely a great purchase, ticks all the boxes for me.The speaker quality is a pass though. The screen is the best part about the laptop except for its brightness, though for me its fine as i always keep my brightness low.If you're looking for a capable windows business laptop at the right price, look no further.None of the big brands will match the same build quality and tech provided at this price.Go for it without any reservations, you will not regret it.",1
Â This laptop has very poor soundRunning smoothly and quality is goodNo fan soundIssue is battery is hardly 5 to 6hr if use continue 4k video with full soundOverall it value for money as compared to similar products in the market I boughtnotebook ultra  i5 16gb 512gb at 62000 on 9/2/22Bad part is sound is very less and usb portnote: dispointment about design of exost fan heating on back in continue using,1
"The laptop has been proven to be a superior machine in terms of quality and performance despite a competitive price there has been some compromises to reduce the price such as absence of dedicated GPU, a card slotbut for a normal user like me it should not matter much so I'd give it a 4.5 stars a best buy itself, xiomi has created an ecosystem now and I've become a part of it",1
"I had bought the laptop in sep, and it just went blank after 2 months of use.The laptop was not getting charged or switching on.It's been in the service center for the past 18 days, with no solution to the problem.The customer service of Mi is so pathetic, with absolutely no follow up.Absolute waste of money.",1

"Â I brought this laptop around 20days ago in Amazon summer sale. Till now it is super fine. Everything look good. It is a  productive laptop. Screen resolution is damn good. It is so high that even Microsoft window can't able to handle some task. Boot time is around 10sec, shut down in 3 sec.Yeah, speaker is not good as like other specialization but I'm used to it. If you have bluetooth earphone it work very good with PC.Else then speaker evening is good and fine.Will post another review after user of 90 days.( Yes it is hard to believe some new product like xiaomi, realme in these products but beleive me you'll never be regret after buying. It is worth buying in this price segment. )",0

Every thing is good if sound is improved then it's unbeatable.,1
Â The Speaker Quality is little low side. Screen resolution is awesome. Bazzels are perfect to the screen ratio. Fast performance 512GB/16GB. Wifi Connectivity is superfast. Bluetooth connectivity is too fast with bluetooth mouse.,1
"User experience is awesome. Screen display is too good. Metallic body, keys background light and battery backup are the best key features of this product. Only one draw back that is speaker volume. We wonât get much sound as get with others companies laptops. Apart from that this completely value for the money.",1
"Overall MI Notebook Ultra good product, good screen quality, good wifi 6 speed, windows 11 (update),booting speed is good, built quality is V good, but Speaker is little bit disappointing & also battery life about 6 hrs in balance mode after full charge , this is very disappointing. Theses demerits make average product in High price.",1
you cant get everything .. for such crisp display it gives only about 3 hours battery life.. that is also on balanced mode.,1
"Â This is my first laptop ð» . I really appreciate the quality of laptop it's pure metallic & looks absolutely like true mackbook i know this because i have a mackbook so i know it very well , only one disappointed point it to give a more louder speaker but if you switch settings from music to gaming mode the speaker became too better not that much high like my mackbook but it's really fine because in such price it provides lot's of things in it & the battery lasts 11 hours continuously using YouTube  . My suggestion go for it âºï¸.Thank you",0
"I got this laptop for 53k after exchange with my 10year old hp laptop. For this money i am very much satisfied with this laptop. Display is soo good. One of the best display in this price range. Speakers are very bad. I use bluetooth speaker. Can play casual games, but cannot be used for hard core gaming. Laptop is very light at 1.7kg it feels light weight for this screen size. I request everyone to go with ultra if you are looking for entertainment purpose. It really worth it.",1
"Â Don't scared of Chinese products, this is too good well built and contains all the best features. Small heat can be sensed while multi tasking but not when you are sitting under the fan or AC. SSD and processor make it supper fast and all their claims are right except battery. If you are going to use it for online classes (video mode on), you will get only 5-6 hours of battery life. If you are using normal task without internet, you will get 10 hours. Very slim, looks nice and professional but bulky",1
"Hi All,I am a devops engineer and I purchased it because I wanted to learn new technologies which requires high end configurations on your machine.I have used it for 2 days as of now but this laptop has live up to the expectations.Pros:1.

You have to install macro key software package from their repository on your own.",1

"I got my laptop delivered today from Amazon. As I was looking for an extended warranty, I called mi.com and was asked to call oneassist to get the warranty. They offered extended two years warranty at 6499 while the same plan if purchased from mi.com along with the laptop is 3699.  I called mi customer care and the reason given was since you have purchased from Amazon, our partners can't provide you at the same rate and you should have bought from mi.com. Why is this not mentioned in Amazon or mi website as a disclaimer. I felt really cheated and this is not what I expected from Amazon nor Xiaomi.Updating after using for three months. Motherboard problem in three months. Can you imagine. The c c type charging port was not working and had given to an authorised service centre. It's been three weeks and no one called back after checking the issue. When I called they are saying motherhood issue and they have ordered the part and the company is not sending the part. They asked us to call and order the part. Pls don't buy MI PRODUCT. They don't provide good service nor extented warranty. Deeply regret for investing in this product",0
1. Open DTS Audio Processing2. Select Games Mode3. Open Graphic EQ and toggle it on4. Increase EQ volume of each band (I have set it to 5),0
"Please do not buy this brand laptop. I bought it on 16 March. After 3 months of using it, i can definitely say it is not worth buying. I have i5 11th gen 16gb 512gb varient. Still it hangs sometime even when i am not using internet on it. While watching videos, it hangs sometimes. And now it's screen is not working properly. The quality of screen was good but now it is not working all black. WTF. Only 3 month working screen. Now I have to go back and forth to mi center to claim warranty. I don't have time for that. Even most of you too.Always buy laptop from the brand who have name in their field. They are new and giving nothing right now.",0
Â Too much heat and very poor audio quality,1
"1st day review, product received in good condition within time. Installation completes and windows activated. However, while restarting, an consecutive error (5 times) shows that ""ms team.exe - bad image"". Dont know why?",1
"Â Durability issuesLaptop  started getting issues in less than 2 months. The delete key is kind of stuck and is not coming outside. Had to take to service center and is taken for 1 week. He says there is some issue with delete and backspace keys, probably the mechanism is reversed. When i asked for a replacement he said, can not be done as it more than 10 days after purchase. So be careful with your money and go somewhere else, because you dont want to buy a laptop for 76+ and start going to service center from the second month onwards.",1
Pros:Great display..Great speed...Great metallic design...Great performance....Highly responsive fingerprint scanner..Typing feels marvelous..Battery backup satisfactorily upto 3hrs.. (we cannot expect much at this price range)Cons:Numeric keypad is absent.Speakers are down facing... Hence you won't feel that much sound.Grill vents in the downside of the laptop are bendable which I quite personally hate so much.Overall:Wonderful product at this price range. Buy it without a second thought.,1
"I was impressed with the specs on papers and yes it delivers that. Everyone has mentioned the pros but after using it for two months, now I think I am in a condition to answer the cons.Pros : you all know .Cons :1. Keyboard is trash. My key (Number 4) came out immediately after purchase. Even i am so fed up of the keyboard , I am using my bluetooth keyboard instead of it.2. When you lock your pc and login again, then suddenly the content on the web browser vanishes for like a long time and you loose control of your screen. Even after having a good processor with SSD, this should not happen.Rest I am happy with the experience.",0
Very nice performance but only One Issue Speaker Sound ð Quantity is very very bad,1
It took more than 5 days for delivery even in Bangalore. Also the offer provided by the seller is not useful and it is just a showcase.Laptop is good and no comments on it for now.,1
"The product is awesome, but gets heated, not overheat, rest is awesome. I recieved damaged product which i was able to replace. If possible will post after recieving the replacement.",1
"Value for money product, laptop speakers are underpowered, build quality and configuration available is best for heavy to moderate usage, speakers are low in volume,needs improvement.",1
"Overall product is good, but charger is missing in package, and web cam is very bad quality",0
Â Quality of the laptop is very pathetic.Because of bad quality it stopped working even before 2 months.I gave it for service and they are not ready to replace with new one.It's motherboard got damaged. MI told they will replace it. I will update after that. Whether it is working or not.On 18th may i received the laptop but still it's having problem. Now MI service center saying display issue. Need to replace display.I will updateUpdate Jun 7/2022: I received the laptop after repair. Initially they didn't change the mother board. Now only mother board replaced. I don't think that it will last even for 1 year. so extended the warranty for 3 years after spending 3500rs.My verdict: Don't buy this crap. Buy only from other established brands,1
Yet another superb device by Xiaomi. I trusted them while they came with their phone amd now with this laptop. First few hours and I can say it is an awesome machine. Rest will update of find anything new that hasn't been said here. Lastly I wish you luck who want to buy this product but not able to because of its unavailability due to high demand.,1
"Updated Review after 5 months use:1.initially felt like volume is very low, but didn't fave any issues for Teams, webex and Zoom meetings.2. Charger is not working from last one week, as of now using the office lenovo laptop charger.3. Some times felt trackpad is stuck after restart  it will work fine.4. Build Quality and keys are strong enough.5. Mainly we can go for this laptop just for Display itself.6. No issues still now in performance wise even I use many applications related to coding.Old Review:Excellent laptop for productivity purpose and watching movies( with external speakers ð).Display is awesome and Laptop feels very premium. Finger print unlock is very fast and Accurate. Superb build quality.Trackpad is also good,Didn't check the games yet will update the review after one month of use.Programming purpose this is the best Laptop with good display.Booting is very fast and it will open the screen in 5sec with finger print access.Cons which I feel1.even though it is 15 inch lap it doesn't have number keys at right side of the keyboard.2.Volume of the speakers is very less for spending 77k.3. Camera quality is not good.4. Seems Xiaomi compromised on Charger , quality is ok don't know about the durability and also on charger it shows other brand name",0

Windows gesture works fine but struggling on using touchpad due to surface is not smooth enough to glide finger easily. Right and left clicks works fine.2. keyboard looks good but compromised with build quality (sturdiness missing).3.

"The look and feel is premium. Display , sound , RAM, Keyboard all are working well. Mi has been consistent on durability factor too. The only issue is 15 inch screen size, which makes the laptop little bulky and preferably a desktop device. Also the inbuilt webcam could have been of higher resolution (reason for 4-star).",1

I havenât expected a poor sound performance .over al ok but in Thai rove range we expect a decent sound output .unfortunately this one fails here .sound quality is very poor,1
"Sound is really bad. Mobile phone sound comes 10 times louder than the sound output come from this laptop.When it comes to other aspects, itâs really premium build quality and Iâm amazed with the screen resolution of the laptop. Track pad sensitivity is so soft and you feel you are using a premium laptop like MacBook.If only sound issue is resolved in this, nothing can touch in this price range.",1
"Faced automatic shut down a number of times. Went to service centre. The person at service centre told me that the screws to the SSD are missing and asked me whether I opened it.

"This is worst investment I have done in my life. I am a regular user at Amazon and used to buy all my electronic items from here.I was very much impressed with MI notebook Ultra specification and I purchased it for my Son. It got delivered on time and started working very well. Order date was 18th Jan 2022.On one of the Friday after finishing class my son left it on the table and opened on Monday morning for the class. I was surprised that screen is broken, we did not change the location of that laptop for good 2 and half day and screen broke its own.After lot of communication on MI customer care (worst Customer care), I came to know that it does not come in warranty and I have to pay 16000 INR for screen replacement. Due to the need of laptop I agreed. But after that also no one has come to replace this. I am continuing following up with CC and they always says someone will come today but till now (4th Feb 2022) , Noone has come and I have lost my investment of 63000 Rupees. I will never buy MI products in my life for sure.",1
Laptop is good. But due to high resolution the battery life is not that great. Lasts upto 4-5 hour on avg usage. The bad thing which I experience is that the charging adaptor get too much warm when it charge for solid one hour. Dont know why but I feel its due to fast charging.,1
"If productivity is your main agenda in a windows package, then it really doesn't get better than this. The value this laptop provides is unmatched in the market , especially the display which is going to leave your breathless. This is pure windows in a good hardware package by Xiaomi. No bloatware and ads at all.Thoroughly happy with the purchase.",0
"I have been using this laptop from quite some time now and really the sound & battery life is were this laptop fails, there speaker is so weak, I would say worst as the sound is so less.I am have been using this laptop from some lite to medium tasks and its has 3 hrs of backup",1
Better go for 16 GB variant. The laptop boots very fast. Display is very good. Fingerprint lock is very fast. Build quality is good.Speaker sound volume is very less. Camera quality is very average.,1
"Got it delivered today, the build quality is great, display is amazing. Performance is also good.Only disappoinment is with sound. It is very low, even ur mobile sound could be louder then this. Xiaomi should definitely work on this.",1
"What is excellent: Screen quality, body color and look,Windows with office. Gives decently well performance.Not good:Touchpad is very cheap and you will always need a mouse,Key board is of very low quality and I will need a external keyboard as I am a programmer, doesn't matter much to me as this is will be a spare machine.Sound is extremely low, a lot lower than redmi book(20K cheaper variant from xiomi.Overall good on paper but not so great in practical use.",1
"Looks great, super display and  quite fast so far.Big disspointment is the charger and charging. It has the ugliest legacy looking charger i have seen in recent times.. and no we can't use any usb type c charger to charge the laptop. This is a real bummer, the thunderbolt port also doesny charge the laptop.The webcam and the speakers are also totally useless. So a video call was a disspointing experience.And the free office for home and student didn't get activated for me. All mi support could do was redirect me to a youtube video and microsoft directly. I wasn't able to work around the error msg: office home and student is not associated to your account. Hope it works for others.Happy with the build quality, display, wifi 6 and fast ports.Rest all is just gimick unless some miraculous software update can fix the speakers, webcam and charging options.",1
"I have been using this laptop for 1 week .. everything is top notch.. especially display is awesome.. battery backup is not as per company claim,but you will early get 7 to 8 hr on moderate use..but I am disappointed with it's speaker.. they are low..",1
Best possible clone of MacBook in your budget.I tried to install MacOS and shared this photo with my friends and they thought it was MacBook ðPros -1) Metal build2) Battery backup (my case 6-7hrs)3) Display quality with 90hz performs really well for editing4) Wi-Fi 6 has great connectivity and has thunderbolt 4 portCons-1) It would be great if it come with Ryzen variant and 2gb graphics card2) Intel iris xe donot performs well in high end games (tried watch dogs2)3) the velcro for binding the charger wire is little small and can have problem while binding the wiresOverall it is a good clone for MacBook which comes in a pocket. But there are some concerns about the after sale services..... Let's see it how it happens in upcoming days ð,1
Touch pad is extremely slow and unresponsive.,1
"Â Display is crisp and clearPerformance is good tooDrives are good tooFingerprint is awesomeFront cam is above average (good)Build quality is premiuim (macbook feel)But Xiaomi lacked few things which I noticedThere's no OEM Windows disk included or atleast they should attach a link on their website where all drivers are available.There's no support assist app which can help in installation of drivers, like dell have dell assist and every other brands have that.Speaker quality is good but it's not loud unless you turn off DTS processing app.External graphics card is supported thanks to Thunderbolt 4 but there should have one more option with discrete graphics card for civil and mechanical engineers.This pc can handle casual gaming but for heavy gaming it should not be your first choice.",0
Performance some what better. But poor battery. Not even come for 4hrs continuous. But they mentioned 12 hrs battery. But practically not working,1
You can't hear anything so it's a big big no for entertainment and you can't return it only replacement.  This speakers problem is with each and every laptop,1
When we plug in for charging Linux os and chromeOS  it shutdown immidiatly.touch pad is very sensitive some time not work .sound volume almost to mute.,1
Â ð¡ð¡after 3 days it was turning on but the display was black . no light in  worst experience from xiaomi .when you buy a product for 64k price you expect from that .. and in just three daysð¡ð¡,0
"I just received this laptop earlier today. Got it on the first flash sale. I bought the highest specifications available at 16GB RAM, I7 Processor. So far I have some observations to share. I am categorizing them below for your reference.Pros:1. Exceptional build quality. This one unlike its predecessor feels very premium. Of course, it has a very heavy influence from MacBook design. But I won't complain. I love the build of this machine2. Beautiful display. No other laptops give you this high-resolution matt finish display. The 3K display at this price point is just nuts. Not only does it make consuming multimedia an enjoyable experience, but being productive using Microsoft apps and other apps is very good too thanks to the 3:2 aspect ratio. WFH is a breeze if you work on a lot of spreadsheets as this aspect ratio helps in showing more rows and columns on the display and the high resolution helps in clarity on what you see on screen. An absolute win here for the laptop. Also, scrolling on this screen is super smooth thanks to the 90 Hz refresh rate3. Great Keys and trackpad area: The butterfly keys are so good to type on and the large precision trackpad is a joy4. 16GB RAM, 512GB NVME SSD &  i7 Processor: Apps launch quick thanks to fast NVME SSD. You can have multiple chrome tabs and other apps open thanks to 16GB RAM. Remember, this device is not meant for hardcore gamers. This laptop is meant for users who use the device for a lot of office work that needs high processing power. Example: If you work on a lot of spreadsheets, code, a lot of chrome tabs, work on databases, etc. This is what the laptop is for. Tasks that require high processing power are what you get. Of course, you can game on it, but light ones at best. Also, not everyone is a YouTubers or a graphics designer. YouTubers only focus on video editing apps, photoshop, etc. But productivity means a hell of lot more than this laptop does without dropping a sweat :)5. Great port selection: You get a couple of USB C ports and a thunderbolt port for connecting external devices6. Fast fingerprint reader with windows hello feature!Cons:1. Very poor speakers: Those 2 2W speakers are very mediocre. It is good for video calls and office calls and maybe watching a video or 2. But not more than that. The speakers lack bass and treble and the volume output is very tiny. Recommeded to use any earphones or headphones to consume media (3.5 mm jack has good audio output)2. Keyboard layout: This might be a personal preference, but I find the Home, End, Pg Up & Dn keys on the right corner of the keyboard to be confusing. I have already hit the Pg UP key multiple times instead of the Enter key and the same is the case with the Home button instead of the Delete key3. The trackpad clicks: Although the gestures work great and the smooth navigation of the trackpad is good, the clicks kind of feels weird. It sounds plasticy and those click sounds can be annoying to someOverall recommending this laptop for anyone who wants a great home laptop with no compromise of WFH setup as well as consumes a lot of media. Kudos to Xiaomi for bringing such a great device to India.",0
"I purchase the mi notebook ultra 5 months ago today i am writing the review because i have issue in screen display and touch pad both are not working properly.1.The screen display blurs after 10,15 minutes of use2.Touch pad cursor not moving",1
"Â I bought the i7 variant with the 16 GB ram.GOOD:*)High-res 90Hz 16:10 display*)Comfortable keyboard*)Relatively portable, well built*)Good overall performance*)Very good value for moneyBAD:*)Gets hot when running heavy workloads*)Weak speakers*)Soldered RAM*) Battery running time is very less*) Can play only casual games(not recommended for heavy gaming)*) Windows 11 isn't that much stable",1
"ProsGreat price to value proposition. Similar spec laptops cost twice as much from established brands.Beautiful 15.6 inch anti glare 16:10 aspect ratio matte screen. 16:10 ratio helps to see more lines in excel/word documents compared to 16:9 aspect ratio. But 16:9 seems more suited for viewing videos since no horizontal black bars at the top and bottom of screen.Elegant looks in full metallic body. Grey colour variant looks stunning. Like an affordable windows macbook. Solid built with no flex in the laptop body.Thunderbolt 4 port for versatile connectivity. Connect 2 4k monitors simultaneously from same thunderbolt port. Thunderbolt is exclusive to 11th gen Intel core i5/i7 and not available yet in AMD ryzen 7 series processors.Charge through either thunderbolt port or type c portMacro key which can be used to quick launch an app like chrome by drag and drop of app into the macro key input area.Battery charge indicator with 3 colours. Red for  charge less than 20, orange from 20 to 90 and green for charge more than 90 percentage.90hz display with 3k resolution. Scrolling very smooth. fn+s key to switch between 60hz and 90hz refresh rateCore i7 11th gen processor - breeze through normal workloads. Haven't heard the cooling fans kicking in yet.512gb nvme ssd for speedy launch of programming ide like pycharm.16gb ram - most of the time 8 gb freeIntel iris graphics - haven't tried any games yet but 4k YouTube videos are smooth.Wifi 6 and Bluetooth 5.1 for reliable connectivity.65w usb type c charger - full charge in 90 mins.Can use 65w mobile phone charger to charge this laptop.Fingerprint sensor and power button combined.Good loud speakers after enabling games mode on inbuilt dts app and turning on Equalizer.Lifetime validity Office 2019 included - get ready to work on excel Power point etc without spending additional for Microsoft office software. Activation also easy by giving personal email while launcing office app first time.Soft relatively silent keys with good travel and 2 levels of backlight for working at night. Comfortable to type for long.Usable 720p camera for zoom/teams call. Disable digital video stabilization setting from camera app else there will be delay in video.Close to 10 hour battery backup after full charge. Battery drain also reasonable under normal workloads. Battery stand by good.Large trackpad which is good and supports gestures like gentle single tap for left click, gentle tap with 2 fingers together for double click which removes need for press/click of trackpad. Configure touchpad options for better results.Good palm rejection and comfortable edges while typing on keyboard.Hinge closes in a smooth pleasant manner with enough cushioningHassle free exchange by Amazon for 7 year old base model macbook air.No cost emi for 3 monthsWhat could have been improved to make this laptop even better:Mi 67w sonic charger which has a slim profile should have been provided instead of the rather  uninspiring default legacy kind of looking LITEON company charger.Small size of shift key on right takes time to get used to. Could have been a normal size shift key.No dedicated sd card slot to quickly transfer photos from SLR to laptop. Have to rely on usb cables.No dedicated number keys even though laptop is a 15.6 inch one. Would have been better to have dedicated number keys while working on excel.Voice capture using inbuilt microphone not the loudest. Use a wired or wireless headphone for voice capture.A bit on heavier side while picking up.May be due to the grade 6 sandblasted aluminium used.Backlight doesn't stay on. Goes off after sometime of inactivity and has to be renabled. But it seems there is an option in bios to keep it on the whole time once selected.Default sound output from speakers not loud enough. Only once games mode is selected and equalizer is enabled from inbuilt dts app does the sound output cross 80 decibel.",0
"Thanks to livetre.com who's reviewing this laptop right now. Like many already pointed out the volume is very low when you get the laptop and also the keyboard backlight goes off after every 15 sec if not touched.? But there's a fixIn the windows start search 'dts' and open the app called dts audio processing and choose the Game Mode t0 get loud sound.And for the keyboard backlight to get always on, Restart and press F2 to enter in to bios. look for keyboard backlight power and set to standard mode instead of power save mode for backlight.only downside of this laptop is the trackpad click. Due to large trackpad the clicks feels stiff and weird.",0
"Updated Review after 5 months use:1.initially felt like volume is very low, but didn't fave any issues for Teams, webex and Zoom meetings.2. Charger is not working from last one week, as of now using the office lenovo laptop charger.3. Some times felt trackpad is stuck after restart  it will work fine.4. Build Quality and keys are strong enough.5. Mainly we can go for this laptop just for Display itself.6. No issues still now in performance wise even I use many applications related to coding.Old Review:Excellent laptop for productivity purpose and watching movies( with external speakers ð).Display is awesome and Laptop feels very premium. Finger print unlock is very fast and Accurate. Superb build quality.Trackpad is also good,Didn't check the games yet will update the review after one month of use.Programming purpose this is the best Laptop with good display.Booting is very fast and it will open the screen in 5sec with finger print access.Cons which I feel1.even though it is 15 inch lap it doesn't have number keys at right side of the keyboard.2.Volume of the speakers is very less for spending 77k.3. Camera quality is not good.4. Seems Xiaomi compromised on Charger , quality is ok don't know about the durability and also on charger it shows other brand name",1
"Got this laptop after reading many reviews and much research but after receiving the package, when I booted the product for the first time. There was a surprise waiting in the form of screen bleeding, I called the CS and their response was quick and satisfactory but the seller is not providing the stock for replacement as I purchased it during sale and bank offer and therefore didn't wanted a refund. Sadly the seller hasn't updated the stock yet and I am still waiting for it in order to get a replacement. Will edit this review after next update from CS.",0
Do not buy this if your are looking for long backup go with other brands.Battery backup is 03 hours only.Laptop sound is average.Boot up timing 04 seconds.Look very impressive.,1
"Dont buy this laptop,its not working after one week of purchase",1
"I was very impressed when i checked on their website that 50 percent of the battery charges in 30 mins, which is not the fact. So i went for it. Rest everything is good. Even battery life is good",1
Everything is good but sound quality disappointed me!!,1
"Everything else is great except sound quality.Sound output is extremely poor. Charging is slow,it could have been better.",1
Value for money.  It is a powerhouse.  Brilliant display,1
Pros:Great display..Great speed...Great metallic design...Great performance....Highly responsive fingerprint scanner..Typing feels marvelous..Battery backup satisfactorily upto 3hrs.. (we cannot expect much at this price range)Cons:Numeric keypad is absent.Speakers are down facing... Hence you won't feel that much sound.Grill vents in the downside of the laptop are bendable which I quite personally hate so much.Overall:Wonderful product at this price range. Buy it without a second thought.,0
"Hi All,I am a devops engineer and I purchased it because I wanted to learn new technologies which requires high end configurations on your machine.I have used it for 2 days as of now but this laptop has live up to the expectations.Pros:1. Bright amazing screen.2. Super fast to use.Cons:1. MS Office is there but excel, word, ppt are not installed as individual app. They are running on cloud.2. Speakers sound is low.3. You have to install macro key software package from their repository on your own.",0
"I have been using it since 2 days and it's working flawlessly. Screen quality is absolutely mind-blowing. Keypad works beautifully well. Battery backup is also V good. I have been using it today since 8 hours and still it's showing 39 percent battery. Talking about cons:1) Speaker quality is not very good. Mobile speaker has louder sound than this laptop.2) After you scroll through many tabs in chrome, the tab refreshes many times though it doesn't happened every time. But it's fixable with an software update.Other than that there's nothing that i can point out that i didn't like about this laptop.Just go for it without a second thought.You are getting a Macbook like laptop at half the price ð",1

The product turned on for a few minutes and then abruptly turned off and was not turning on after. I'm disappointed â¹ï¸,1
"Great Build Quality - Sturdy Hinge, Excellent Display, Clicky buttons with adequate keytravelDecent Audio Setup - Loud Enough",1
"This is after using for 20 daysEverything is good , screen looks pretty , build quality is great and opens with one hand , no lag no screen damage whatsoever6-7hrs of battery life easily with occasional gaming , touchpad is big and pretty responsive for all the multitouch swiping , adjusting to the keyboard takes a little time shouldnt be a problemrestart is fast (10 sec tops )IssuesIt gets warm after continuous use for 5-6 hrs and while gaming( not to be worried much )the sound is clearly less ( except for spotify and youtube which works fine) - try switching off the dts mode ( game mode is not suitable for music and movie although the sound increases with that)",1
First laptop that was delivered crashed intermittently every 10 minutes starting from the first day. Thanks to Amazon for replacing the laptop although convincing the amazon executives was bit tedious. But Xiaomi needs to improve on Quality control. Its just been a day with this replaced one so fingers crossed.,1
"Pro: screen, price, looks and built quality, touch pad, macro key for quick launch, finger print scanner no bloatware and adsCons: Very bad speaker that ruins the screen experience, awful customer supportOverall: A good laptop for the money, but serious concerns on long term use. Based on Xiaomi style of not providing software updates to its phone, I expect they won't give any kind of updates to the drivers in the laptop.I brought this laptop after using a HP sleekbook laptop for 10 years which didn't gave me any trouble that made me go to a service center without. Day 1 with this I had to visited the service center which was a waste of time as wellWhen I brought this laptop, I didn't get the MS office preinstalled. Neither Amazon nor Xiaomi(including service center) was able to bring amicable solution. I was asked to return the laptop for refund, which I cannot do at the moment due to my work and absence of a backup laptop. So I am kind of stuck with this.",1
Great display. Awesome connectivity options. Butter smooth performance. Overall great value for money combo.I was hesitant to go with the brand as it's not an established brand in the laptop space. However I'm pleased with the overall package. It's a perfect fit for people looking for a powerful machine for productivity purpose.,1
I don't wanna write more about the device as most of the popular tech reviewers and blog writers covered it already and the experience is exactly the sameThe one major issue with this is the speakers which are only distorting when music is being played but for vocals and bgms it sounds good not sure how can some one find these type of speakersð but via bluetooth headset it sounds amazing and this is definitely something which compensate for majority of the users,1
"Superb build quality, awesome screen, and the main highlight of this laptop is its design, it feels very premium, battery backup is also very good i got 8 hours backup in normal usage and 6 hours in heavy usage. Overall it is a very decent product you can definitely go for it.",1
"ohk so first of all.pros:-1.great display2.keyboard is very tactile and nice3.finger print scanner is just awesome4: overall no performance issues5.build quality is just great.i mean its just top of the line.1.79 kg umm you can't say it's light but yeah it's not that 3-4lg like those damnn gaming laptops ð. it's quite slim.easily can be opened by one hand and let me tell u it helps a lot atleast you don't have to pur your coffee mug down to open the laptop ð.(fyi guys:-i bought the i5 16 gb variant)you also must go 16 gb if you want to use it for like more than 2 years.cons:-1.trackpad quality is little disappointing imean it's great,but it's just that it fells a little how can i say that luke mushy or something like that you have to get used to it.2.heat yup let me tell you heat issues are there like even if u have a 16 gb variant and u are running like just 3-4 applications  it will get like more warmer than usuall.like on the f2-f3 keys and above section.so yeah you can expect more heating while doing extensive tasks.like video rendering or slight gaming.3.i don't know if this happened with me only or it was a bug but while set up i was facing a white screen issue after logging in my microsoft account.i had to re-start the laptop like couple of times,then the setup got completed.4.speakers those damnnn speakers.bc mera phone jyada tez sound krta hai un speakers se.i would recommend to get a mini Bluetooth speaker for content consumption.i download a app called audio relay,so it let me use my phone's speaker as a wireless speaker.ohk so that was all form my side",0
"When i was setting it up..and installing windows updates it crashed two times and rebooted,after then windows Hello sign in feature was disabled automatically, fingerprint was working fine for first five days and then it showed error Message as this feature is unavailable..Raised a replacement request with Amazon and thank to supportive staff they barely took 15 min to create a replacement order thanks Amazon.I i bought mi notebook ultra i7 varient.Apart from this software bug laptop is really awesome..it has this flagship display. Build quality is awesome too.. battery life was decent for my working (around 7-8 hours) over all for 68k it was a steal deal for me..",0
Â Mi NoteBook Ultra is one of the best Laptop in the market for home and office usage. Its display is Mind-blowing with 90hz refresh rate which performs really well.Received out of the box Windows 11 now and MS Office. Battery backup 8hrs in normal working.The laptop weight distribution is excellent and the screen can be opened with a single hand.Its Fingerprint sensor is lightening fast and works very well.,1
Laptop is dead in just week days of usage. Dont buy it at any cost.,1
"Pehli baat to is laptop ko buy karna hi Mahabharat hai.Not available anywhere in NCR region i5/16gb. Just imagine not available in capital city!!Luckily i got from Amazon which took 8 days to deliver since it wasn't on stock.About the laptop its beauty!! hats off to Xiaomi for this. As RAM is not upgradable, never buy 8gb version.",1
"Really like this laptop, gives MacBook feel with great windows 11 performance. Watching movies n video is a treat on it. The only con I see is the sound quality jus being average at best, otherwise a solid product.",1
Really good and looks really good and stylish.I would recommend this product to buy,1
"The look and feel is premium. Display , sound , RAM, Keyboard all are working well. Mi has been consistent on durability factor too. The only issue is 15 inch screen size, which makes the laptop little bulky and preferably a desktop device. Also the inbuilt webcam could have been of higher resolution (reason for 4-star).",0
I have been using this laptop for data analysis and visualisation. It is extremely fast compared to my previous laptop and its battery duration when run on Windows is really good. Very good screen resolution to watch movies. Only draw back is speakers volume but it is definitely worth buying this laptop.,0
"Â You will not get an option to buy extended warranty while buying the laptop at amazon and also after receiving the laptop Mi will not let your buy the additional 2 years warranty from Mi within the 3 days of delivery... SAD, I bought it under the impression I could buy mi extended warranty after purchase of the product :(",1
"I was impressed with the specs on papers and yes it delivers that. Everyone has mentioned the pros but after using it for two months, now I think I am in a condition to answer the cons.Pros : you all know .Cons :1. Keyboard is trash. My key (Number 4) came out immediately after purchase. Even i am so fed up of the keyboard , I am using my bluetooth keyboard instead of it.2. When you lock your pc and login again, then suddenly the content on the web browser vanishes for like a long time and you loose control of your screen. Even after having a good processor with SSD, this should not happen.Rest I am happy with the experience.",1
Speaker in not good.if u are looking for better audio then donot buy. U need to use earphone mostly.,1
Â This laptop has very poor soundRunning smoothly and quality is goodNo fan soundIssue is battery is hardly 5 to 6hr if use continue 4k video with full soundOverall it value for money as compared to similar products in the market I boughtnotebook ultra  i5 16gb 512gb at 62000 on 9/2/22Bad part is sound is very less and usb portnote: dispointment about design of exost fan heating on back in continue using,0
I liked this product very much as it has long duration of battery life and it's screen doesn't reflect light as it is anti glare.It also has a nice camera,1
"Everything is great except for inbuilt speakers, which produces very less sound, especially while using on bed. On flat surfaces like table, it is okay. It can be somewhat corrected by disabling inbuilt DTS sound processing, or switching to game mode.It is recommended to buy a small Bluetooth speaker along with this laptop.Highlight of this laptop is 90 Hz screen refresh rate. It is an underrated feature, but scrolling is joy because of that.",0
"I got this laptop for 53k after exchange with my 10year old hp laptop. For this money i am very much satisfied with this laptop. Display is soo good. One of the best display in this price range. Speakers are very bad. I use bluetooth speaker. Can play casual games, but cannot be used for hard core gaming. Laptop is very light at 1.7kg it feels light weight for this screen size. I request everyone to go with ultra if you are looking for entertainment purpose. It really worth it.",0
"I like to say that its a perfect laptop for person who wants to use a premium product at a affordable price ....only thing I feel that definitely need to be improve is speakers and charging support with mobile chargerupdate: during uses about 1 month laptop start giving problems like hanging on usb plugged in , problem increased after upgrade to windows 11 , so i downgrade it to windows 10 .....one time i need to customer support that is very pathetic and irresponsible... they take my laptop for 8 days and not doing anything for my problems ....better to go for renowned  brands than xiaomi",1
Yet another superb device by Xiaomi. I trusted them while they came with their phone amd now with this laptop. First few hours and I can say it is an awesome machine. Rest will update of find anything new that hasn't been said here. Lastly I wish you luck who want to buy this product but not able to because of its unavailability due to high demand.,0
"I received the laptop on 22 sep 2021. Its build is superb, display is by far the best. But on just the third day of usage the keyboard started to malfunction. Somehow the keyboard is behaving as if the shift keys are randomly presses. All trackpad functions first malfunctioning then all of a sudden it just stopped working. Now i am thinking that did i do any mistake in placing my trust in Xiaomi. Are they giving cheap quality hardware packed in a high quality build??? Hoping to see a quick resolution to my problem.",1

Keyboard design for function keys only works in combination with fn keys. The end key and page up & page down key also wrongly positioned.,1
Â Writing review after 4 months of usage.If you want a good performance laptop with latest updates then don't buy this.I'm using this since January 2022 but it didn't get update for Windows 11 yet.It usually looses internet connectivity while being on sleep while my Dell laptop doesn't do so. Sometimes it's fingerprint also doesn't worksIt's speakers doesn't have that much efficiency.It's battery also get drained very fast.If you want a good looking laptop with higher screen quality and great resolution you can absolutely buy this.Conclusion: In my opinion it doesn't worth the price because of so much glitches,0
Value for moneyâ¦. Far ahead than competitors.,1

"Pros:1) Build quality.2) Display (best I have ever seen amongst laptops).3) Keyboard, great typing experience.4) Fingerprint, lightening fast.Cons:1) Sound speakers downwards, would have been better on surface.

"Bought the Mi Ultra laptop during the first sale on 31st Aug. Extremely disappointed with the laptop as well as Mi Support.12/09: Laptop doesn't turn on anymore. It has been 10 days, so cannot even return it. On the 6th day, the laptop went into a continuous restart loop which I fixed with hard shut down 3 times after watching some YouTube videos. And then it was working okay for 2 days. Now it doesn't even start. The charge light also doesn't come on. Nothing happens on pressing the power button. Nothing happens when you connect the charger. It's dead. Need to take it to the service center just 10 days into the purchase! Don't buy this, all the great specs are useless if it doesn't start!Update 13/09: I gave it for service and they are saying the battery and motherboard is defective and they need to replace it! I'm shocked. It's a brand new laptop and in 10 days the battery and motherboard is gone? How can that happen? I've hardly even used it! And they also say that since it's a new laptop the parts are taking time to come to the service center! Better to buy a reliable HP, Dell, Lenovo laptop even if it's a bit more expensive!Update 20/09: It has been with Mi service center for 8 days now. Everytime I call them they say it will get fixed in 2 days. On probing further they said there is a hardware problem. The battery and motherboard needs to be replaced! Wow I can't understand how the battery and motherboard can have problems in just 10 days of purchase? It's clearly a manufacturing defect from Xiaomi. They say they have ordered the parts but they haven't received it since it's a new model! Unbelievable!Just lost lot of money and peace with this laptop! Don't trust Xiaomi from now.23/09: They called me from the service center and asked me to collect a replacement laptop. I got a brand new laptop unopened and I opened it and checked in the service center itself. It seems that they couldn't fix the old laptop and had to send it back, so I got lucky. Else, I would have got a repaired one.Anyway, I'm happy I got a new replacement laptop and currently it's working well.",0
I bought this product even after reading negative reviws regarding its reliability due to its build quality but that was a mistake!!The laptop got shutdown suddenly on the second day and did not bootup since then.. it was dead. I had to return it..Terrible experience!,1
Â Backlight screen bleeding in my xiaomi notebook ultra. Too much disappointing.I want t replace the laptop.,1
"Â I like it much .There was problem in starting it charges in 4 hours . But now it take only 1.5 h to full charge as i call of customer care they help me through service app which enhances my efficiency of laptop overall . It battery goes up to 8h for normal video watch . But more battery consumption during game play 1.5 h .Its speaker are decent then my mobile also as the voice is not so clear. But you can manage it you can buy external speakersIt started in 9 sec only so very fast I played watch dogs 2 game that play smoothly in 720 p low quality.Its display 3.2 is really very nice as you can see in my video as make by mobile there in not any issues of lines during capture. The hp laptop near me display looks very white no colour accuracy, whenever this laptop colour accuracy are very nice , i have become fan of it .The view of video watching is future proof",0
Good performance but heats up a lot. Infact this laptop cannot be on the lap top!Otherwise all works as advertised,1
"I bought the product with configuration of i5, 16gb RAM, 512 SSD, and here is my review after the first day use:1) Display:Display of the laptop is excellent. I was looking for one with a good display that will help me work without the monitor connected.2) Battery:With a moderate use, battery performance on the first day was really good. I worked for nearly 5 hours (out of which 2 hrs of zoom calls) and 50% drained.3) Camera:Camera is just fine for video calls, not bad actually as it's used mainly for video conferences or online classes etc.4) Speakers:Inbuilt speakers are fine for the above mentioned uses. I felt it's more effective when it's kept on a surface than we keep it on lap.5) Performance:Performance wise there is not much notable difference from those of others with the same specification3) Others:Fingerprint, keyboard, mouse pad are also impressive in the first instance.My take: Overall a good, worthy and budget friendly product when compared to those in the same category!Thanks to Amazon too, to deliver it quickly and to give an option to buy for a day when the stock is up",0
Screen is just top notch and build quality is awesome..keyboard feels great and with i5 11 you will never run into any issue so just go for it if you want to have a premium experience...too bad for dell and hp man...xiomi has killed every competition out there man,1
"I like the laptop as it have premium feel macbook look alike, not comfortable with keypad position, battery life drops significantly  with continuous word Excel tasks, not as per they claim 11 hours provides around 5-6 hours. Lastly speakers are not loud. Other than that spec wise, look wise, performance is spot on",1
"Very fast charging, fast processing speed and amazing display but sound is very low and camera quality also not good but yet value for monay. Must go for this",1
"When the laptop is connected to charging point and I am not doing anything on the laptop, some process gets stuck (like edge) and CPU utilization goes high & the FAN starts making noise.if i disconnect the Charger then the problem goes away, another option is to go and kill the hanged application/process.I went to the service centre they did a software reinstall but its still not solved.Now i really want to return this fault product but as per amazon policy u can not return after 10 days, I am using this laptop for 45 days approx.  i am really not sure if mi can fix the issue ( or first identify ).i can foresee myself knocking the service Center door more often now.",0
"Very smooth and comfortable, premium Quality at that price point.Fully Satisfied.",1
Â Unacceptable...tried to contact the customer service but they did not respond and Amazon currently does not have debt service it so this is like just an acceptable. After being such a fan of Mi book the everything works well but getting a defective device at such a high price not what they expected from this very bad very bad,1
"If productivity is your main agenda in a windows package, then it really doesn't get better than this. The value this laptop provides is unmatched in the market , especially the display which is going to leave your breathless. This is pure windows in a good hardware package by Xiaomi. No bloatware and ads at all.Thoroughly happy with the purchase.",1
Charger is of average quality and the speakers are not up to the merk honesty. otherwise it contains all the specs one could ask for but 64 K is a bit high value.60-62K would've been great and a great deal honestly. But really happy and satisfied with overall performance so far. Will update after long term use.,1
"Â This is my first laptop ð» . I really appreciate the quality of laptop it's pure metallic & looks absolutely like true mackbook i know this because i have a mackbook so i know it very well , only one disappointed point it to give a more louder speaker but if you switch settings from music to gaming mode the speaker became too better not that much high like my mackbook but it's really fine because in such price it provides lot's of things in it & the battery lasts 11 hours continuously using YouTube  . My suggestion go for it âºï¸.Thank you",1
"I received the laptop on 22 sep 2021. Its build is superb, display is by far the best. But on just the third day of usage the keyboard started to malfunction. Somehow the keyboard is behaving as if the shift keys are randomly presses. All trackpad functions first malfunctioning then all of a sudden it just stopped working. Now i am thinking that did i do any mistake in placing my trust in Xiaomi. Are they giving cheap quality hardware packed in a high quality build??? Hoping to see a quick resolution to my problem.",0
I bought this laptop in December 22 2021 and in Feb i lost battery when iam connecting to charger only it's working so please don't buy it go for hp or other branded laptops,1
"Don't buy mi laptop's fully hanging problem and heating after shutdown also battery drain after shutdown, power button not working properly and switch off like power cut while working.. Hanging 6to 8 times per day. Power button should press nearly 5 to 6 times to on the laptop...",1
"No slim book with 16 GB ram, 3.2k display and an aluminum chassis at this price. Would have loved the ryzen variants that were launched in China to be launched here but either way it's still a steal for a deal like this. The only issue is if they provided another fan, instead of a single fan system would have been good cuz I live in a very hot area. The temps go high as 98Â° for 1-2 seconds during a very high load and then goes down at 75Â° immediately after the fan kicks in. Noise of the fan is not noticeable even at high speed. Overall a bank for the buck. Now the only thing left is after sale service and how long this last before its first breakdown.Low sound in speakers can be fixed by selecting gaming mode in dts app coming preinstalled with the laptop.",0
"my adopter has some problems and customer care are now denying to replace or repair,  honestly guys don't ever buy xiaomi laptop,  its totally waste of moneyI have big regret to buy this laptop after using 2 months I am giving review, it  is very nice only look ways otherwise total worst  products xiaomi made it, within two month my adopter stopped working and as per xiaomi policy they have to replace or repair my adopter but they deny,  honestly guys never buy laptop from xiaomi,  they are not good with laptop and service,  I called to service centre they said adopter is not included in guarantee",1
"Display: AwesomeLook and in hand feel: AwesomeBattery: Getting just 4 hrs backup :(Speaker: The only main drawback, disappointed. Thats why giving 4 stars.Performance: AwesomeHeating: No issue as such in normal usages.",0
"I just received this laptop earlier today. Got it on the first flash sale. I bought the highest specifications available at 16GB RAM, I7 Processor. So far I have some observations to share. I am categorizing them below for your reference.Pros:1. Exceptional build quality. This one unlike its predecessor feels very premium. Of course, it has a very heavy influence from MacBook design. But I won't complain. I love the build of this machine2. Beautiful display. No other laptops give you this high-resolution matt finish display. The 3K display at this price point is just nuts. Not only does it make consuming multimedia an enjoyable experience, but being productive using Microsoft apps and other apps is very good too thanks to the 3:2 aspect ratio. WFH is a breeze if you work on a lot of spreadsheets as this aspect ratio helps in showing more rows and columns on the display and the high resolution helps in clarity on what you see on screen. An absolute win here for the laptop. Also, scrolling on this screen is super smooth thanks to the 90 Hz refresh rate3. Great Keys and trackpad area: The butterfly keys are so good to type on and the large precision trackpad is a joy4. 16GB RAM, 512GB NVME SSD &  i7 Processor: Apps launch quick thanks to fast NVME SSD. You can have multiple chrome tabs and other apps open thanks to 16GB RAM. Remember, this device is not meant for hardcore gamers. This laptop is meant for users who use the device for a lot of office work that needs high processing power. Example: If you work on a lot of spreadsheets, code, a lot of chrome tabs, work on databases, etc. This is what the laptop is for. Tasks that require high processing power are what you get. Of course, you can game on it, but light ones at best. Also, not everyone is a YouTubers or a graphics designer. YouTubers only focus on video editing apps, photoshop, etc. But productivity means a hell of lot more than this laptop does without dropping a sweat :)5. Great port selection: You get a couple of USB C ports and a thunderbolt port for connecting external devices6. Fast fingerprint reader with windows hello feature!Cons:1. Very poor speakers: Those 2 2W speakers are very mediocre. It is good for video calls and office calls and maybe watching a video or 2. But not more than that. The speakers lack bass and treble and the volume output is very tiny. Recommeded to use any earphones or headphones to consume media (3.5 mm jack has good audio output)2. Keyboard layout: This might be a personal preference, but I find the Home, End, Pg Up & Dn keys on the right corner of the keyboard to be confusing. I have already hit the Pg UP key multiple times instead of the Enter key and the same is the case with the Home button instead of the Delete key3. The trackpad clicks: Although the gestures work great and the smooth navigation of the trackpad is good, the clicks kind of feels weird. It sounds plasticy and those click sounds can be annoying to someOverall recommending this laptop for anyone who wants a great home laptop with no compromise of WFH setup as well as consumes a lot of media. Kudos to Xiaomi for bringing such a great device to India.",1
Â Battery saver mode in 6 hours & regular mode in 5 hours.Charger adapter got a little hot.8gm RAM in abode application process is medium.,1
"Product is good and nice.But if you want extended warranty and related MI offers.. don't buy from amazon.If you buy from amazon you can get only the standard warranty, others at MI store not applicable.Price is same both in Amazon and MI Store.You can see the Unboxing and First Look and some other details in my video @ Senthil Solo vLogs channel.",1
"The model has very low audio output. Not expected with such an expensive device. Within 2 hours of delivery tried to return this but return is not accepted rather technician visit is scheduled. If sound itself is low in speaker I am not sure what technical is gonna do here. Anyway, waiting for him.Think twice before buying. Total disappointment.",1

Â The laptop is extremely well builtI have i5 8gb variant as 16 gb was out of stock.1) performance is great for this price range is great2) battery life is also good for an instance i started at 9 in the morning at 100% and it lasted for 2 pm.In meanwhile i was continuously using it at 90hz 3 tabs were open in chrome and it was connected to wifi and Bluetooth display brightness was 50% as i was indoor.3) Gaming I don't do heavy gaming but i played valorant on it at 1080p  low graphics and it was giving around 50 to 80 fps . maybe 16 gb varient will give 60 to 90%.4) Charging while using it takes around 3 hours.5) speakers are a little bit low but i didn't faced any problem as i always use earphones or headphones.6) heating i didn't faced any major heating issue.I tried 4k video rendering and valorant but the temperature never exceeded 80Â°C . As i am coming from acer Predator it was really good because in Predator temperature is around 95+ while gaming or editing.But after two days when i was doing a typing test its tab key poped out of keyboard.So immediately contact Amazon and hopefully they raised an return.This time i will wait for 16gb.,1

"Pros:1.good metallic body.2.superb screen.3.one hand screen open.4. Light weight5. Slim design6. Finger print work superb.7. internal hardware specifications are all good.Cons:1. Touchpad is worst. losse fitting sounds on every single tap(I think this issue is with only my unit). Windows gesture works fine but struggling on using touchpad due to surface is not smooth enough to glide finger easily. Right and left clicks works fine.2. keyboard looks good but compromised with build quality (sturdiness missing).3.

"Â I brought this laptop around 20days ago in Amazon summer sale. Till now it is super fine. Everything look good. It is a  productive laptop. Screen resolution is damn good. It is so high that even Microsoft window can't able to handle some task. Boot time is around 10sec, shut down in 3 sec.Yeah, speaker is not good as like other specialization but I'm used to it. If you have bluetooth earphone it work very good with PC.Else then speaker evening is good and fine.Will post another review after user of 90 days.( Yes it is hard to believe some new product like xiaomi, realme in these products but beleive me you'll never be regret after buying. It is worth buying in this price segment. )",1
Noises from the laptop speakers  coming when increasing volume little bit. Very bad experience with new laptop.,1
"Review after 2 months:1. Awesome 4K display - you just can't compare any other laptop.2. Super fast boot and smooth response, no lag, no hang.3. Excellent island keyboard with backlightOnly cons isLow volume, while playing movie, probably you need external speaker or use headphones",1
"It has been just 9 days after purchasing and the laptop is already dead. Got it fixed at the service center. Now dead for the 2nd time. Service took 2 weeks to replace the battery, with the new battery it is still dead. Now they have ordered a motherboard. It has been almost a month now still in the service center. They are not even replacing this laptop with a new laptop.Update:Motherboard replaced. Still dead and no news from the service center, It has been 32 days in the service center. 5 tickets were raised. Got an SMS saying a new laptop will be given and the old one will be replaced. It has been 5 days, got a call again saying that they have canceled the shipment. Had to chase and the local service center had no idea. Had to chase on Twitter. One more ticket was raised. Got a call this morning saying the amount will be refunded. Trying to get the data recovered from my laptop, the local service centre is just not responding to calls in Mangalore.",1
"Â I purchased it for 56999/-Pros: Blazing fast, smooth, no lag, built is excellent. Overall its the best with its price tag.Cons: Speakers are low in volume n bass, no SD port n while charging its body gets current as it doesn't have earthing for cable.",1

Best possible clone of MacBook in your budget.I tried to install MacOS and shared this photo with my friends and they thought it was MacBook ðPros -1) Metal build2) Battery backup (my case 6-7hrs)3) Display quality with 90hz performs really well for editing4) Wi-Fi 6 has great connectivity and has thunderbolt 4 portCons-1) It would be great if it come with Ryzen variant and 2gb graphics card2) Intel iris xe donot performs well in high end games (tried watch dogs2)3) the velcro for binding the charger wire is little small and can have problem while binding the wiresOverall it is a good clone for MacBook which comes in a pocket. But there are some concerns about the after sale services..... Let's see it how it happens in upcoming days ð,0
Best product.. just one thing.. Bettery lyf is around 9.5 hrs.. not 11 hours,1
"It has got a great built and macbook like looks.Excellent weight distribution but kind of slippery.I experienced a screen flickering issue on the last day of return period. The laptop flickered & got frozen, nothing worked after that. I restarted it worked again & then after 15 minutes on Ms Word same thing happened. Nothing was visible during this issue black and white horizontal lines and laptop wasn't responsive. I fortunately got it returned & refunded.Cheap quality charger, heats up a lot with little use.Xiaomi needs to be more reliable in laptop section. Too much cost cutting spoils the whole thing.",0

Like many already pointed out the volume is very low when you get the laptop and also the keyboard backlight goes off after every 15 sec if not touched.? But there's a fixIn the windows start search 'dts' and open the app called dts audio processing and choose the Game Mode t0 get loud sound.And for the keyboard backlight to get always on, Restart and press F2 to enter in to bios. look for keyboard backlight power and set to standard mode instead of power save mode for backlight.only downside of this laptop is the trackpad click.

"Very premium laptop in every sspect except the audio. The sound quality is very poor. If you are looking for great sound quality laptop then better look for hp elite 840 series or similar laptop. But fir rest of the areas this is an awesome laptop. Everything about the laptop barring audio is exceptional. Great battery life, smooth operations, large screen, built in office21,great speed.

"Pros: great display, fast finger print scanner, nice build quality, aluminium body with nice design, good battery life.Cons: speakers are average, it can get scratches on body easily.you can play games on it but it gets heated. I played gta v and nfs rival on 1080p at good fps. not suitable for graphic rich games as it is not a gaming laptop.Overall it is a great value for money.",1
"Battery life is very poor. Even after full charging, it drains very very fast. Within 1 week system performance started to get slow.. Dont worth the money",1
I have been using this laptop for data analysis and visualisation. It is extremely fast compared to my previous laptop and its battery duration when run on Windows is really good. Very good screen resolution to watch movies. Only draw back is speakers volume but it is definitely worth buying this laptop.,1

"Everything is great except for inbuilt speakers, which produces very less sound, especially while using on bed. On flat surfaces like table, it is okay. It can be somewhat corrected by disabling inbuilt DTS sound processing, or switching to game mode.It is recommended to buy a small Bluetooth speaker along with this laptop.Highlight of this laptop is 90 Hz screen refresh rate. It is an underrated feature, but scrolling is joy because of that.",1

For this reason you may start hating it though you have best configuration in this price range. ..Currently, I'm using Bluetooth speaker for audio.",1
"An excellent laptop within this budget range. Sleek stylish and powerful. Very good battery life and an awesome display. The only con is sound quality. Having said that it doesn't mean that the sound quality is poor. The sound quality is great enhanced by DTS but the loudness is poor. Regarding computing tasks, it can carries a heavy ammount of multitasking including coding. The best part is it doesn't heat up at all.",1
"Stunning perfomance.

Â Writing review after 4 months of usage.If you want a good performance laptop with latest updates then don't buy this.I'm using this since January 2022 but it didn't get update for Windows 11 yet.It usually looses internet connectivity while being on sleep while my Dell laptop doesn't do so. Sometimes it's fingerprint also doesn't worksIt's speakers doesn't have that much efficiency.It's battery also get drained very fast.If you want a good looking laptop with higher screen quality and great resolution you can absolutely buy this.Conclusion: In my opinion it doesn't worth the price because of so much glitches,1
"okay got the ultra today and the display is not as amazing as advertised imho. It is extremely sharp (thanks to the 2000p display!) but not at all color accurate. So over saturated that it gives mi and realme phone camera vibes lol. Another example after the iPhone 11 that proves higher resolution != better display.I have an old hp pavilion 14 x360 (14inch 1080p), LG 22MK600M monitor (22 inch IPS LCD 1080p), Lenovo L24i-30 monitor (24 inch IPS LCD 1080p) to compare with and have to say color reproduction is not at all natural on the Mi laptop. And yeah it is the worst of the 4 with Lenovo at 3rd HP 2nd and LG the best. I tested with the famous costa rica 4k video and the greens and yellows on the snake at 0: 07 are so so poor that it almost feels like one bright green. Even looking at the long shots of the trees you can tell the display is so over saturated. Especially looking side by side with others, the differences could easily be spotted (tbh there's no need to look side by side either. you can tell easily, unless you're coming from a TN panel).However everything else about the laptop is great (would've loved ryzen but it's okay considering intel iris xe). 16GB ram with i5 is a combination most tasks find useful but rarely available. Quality of life features like Battery life, thunderbolt, type-c charging, fp scanner, large track-pad and better than average keyboard (I'm used to mechanical so can't appreciate much). Restart takes like 15sec max. wake up from sleep is instant. excellent build (although my hp x360 is good too, so it's not as 'awe'ing to me). the hinge is so satisfying. It's all top notch. Only display didn't reach the expectation.",0
Great laptop and Performance. Display is the major differentiator.Only downside of this laptop is the volume. It's way too low.,1
"Â Positive points1. build quality is next level, like premium product2. Screen quality is awesome â¤ï¸ colors are awesome3. Battery backup is around 9 hours if laptop screen is on 60hzs  refresh rate . If you use 90hzs then you can get battery backup max around 3hrs.4. File transfer speed is awesome . I move 13gb file to another drive it take less than a minute. Transfer speed (300mbps to 600mbps)5. Keys are really soft6. Camera quality is everage.Negative points1. Big negative point is Speakers. Even my phone speaker is louder than laptop speaker2. Can handle games on low resolution this is not a gaming laptop so keep in mind before buy.",1
"I loved the Laptop too much and it's very thin and superb in performance, best in premium quality, seriously have a resemblance to Apple Laptops.",1
"What is excellent: Screen quality, body color and look,Windows with office. Gives decently well performance.Not good:Touchpad is very cheap and you will always need a mouse,Key board is of very low quality and I will need a external keyboard as I am a programmer, doesn't matter much to me as this is will be a spare machine.Sound is extremely low, a lot lower than redmi book(20K cheaper variant from xiomi.Overall good on paper but not so great in practical use.",0
Getting struck 3 to 4 times each hour of working.......,1
"Got this laptop after reading many reviews and much research but after receiving the package, when I booted the product for the first time. There was a surprise waiting in the form of screen bleeding, I called the CS and their response was quick and satisfactory but the seller is not providing the stock for replacement as I purchased it during sale and bank offer and therefore didn't wanted a refund. Sadly the seller hasn't updated the stock yet and I am still waiting for it in order to get a replacement. Will edit this review after next update from CS.",1
"Overrall good product,2 major issues I can see with this laptop,1)battery life2)very low voice",1
