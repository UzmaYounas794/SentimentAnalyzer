The tablet was delivered with dissatisfactory packaging.I purchased this tab because of its 4gb ram expecting smooth tablet experience but I kept experiencing a certain lag with scrolling news feed and playing YouTube JUST AFTER setting up the tablet. That lag is persistent.Battery isn't sufficient as well and it drains quickly.The one pro with this tablet was it display. The display is quite clean and Crisp.READ MORE,0
