"Bought it for light weight tasks - watching video, Netflix, YouTube, and MS Office work. It's been great for past couple of weeks. Enjoying the Full HD screen. Only con with the screen is that it reflects light so best to turn your screen where the light source falls behind the screen. Waiting for Windows 11 hope it will handle it well.READ MORE",1
