Reviews,Verdict
My mother said it's really nifty.,1
Best investment!,1
Came in on time and looks great !!,1
"This is my third PRO.  Hello works great with this version, even in a darken room.  Very responsive.  I use for Lightroom CC and Photoshop CC  and it works great.  Able to down load RAW files very fast and do Post processing when in the field.  I am very impressed with the build quality of the tablet.  Has a USB port that will work with a hub.  Also can connect to a TV through a cable adapter and HDMI to watch shows on the go.",1
"As I said in headline, it is perfect...Can't find anything to complain about it! Anywhere I go, internet is there...Easy to set up, easy to use...",1
"My first one died in two weeks, the replacement has been running well for a year. Love it!Downsides -- replacement charger cord is ridiculously expensive, $70+. Also be very careful which case you buy if you have the fastest processor, some cases labeled as OK for this model will block the vents for the cooling fan resulting in overheating. Slower processor models don't have a cooling fan.",1
"I got the I7, 16GB, 512 BG version.Nice bright screen, and great battery life.High performing, and I'm basically using it as my laptop replacement.Work daily with it.Wish there was a USB-C port for charging.That would make it perfect. But it's Microsoft so you'll have to wait for a Pro 7 for that, maybe.",1
Love it!  Everything I expected and more!,1
got it for my daughter and she loves it,1
"My surface pro 3 began showing signs of failure after a few of years of hard service. This is an awesome upgrade to say the least. Exact same specs as the unit it replaced but this new Surface pro is smooth as butter and the fanless cooling is also a very nice upgrade. The surface pro 3 was not terribly noisy under a load but as they say silence is golden. It seems like Microsoft catches a fair amount of negativity, but they sure make a tablet that is a rock solid laptop alternative.",0
"good product,  highly recommended.",1
"So far I love my new computer. I probably should have gotten one with more memory, but the cost was not in my budget. I added an external hard drive to expand the capability without spending too much.  I think this is going to work out fantastically. The size and light weight of the Surface Pro make it great for taking along on trips.",1
Generally perfect,1
"I've gotten a ton of use out of my Surface Pro 3 (SP3) over the past 3.5 years however the battery life was diminishing rapidly so I decided to upgrade to the new Surface Pro. (I don't know why Microsoft has to confuse everyone by not naming it the Surface Pro 5 but I digress.)Here are the biggest improvements coming from the SP3:-Noticeably thinner and lighter. Makes it easier to handle as a tablet.-Fanless i5 version. Love not having to hear the high-pitched fan.Accessory compatibility:-My SP3 keyboard cover is compatible with this new Surface. Saves me about a hundred bucks.-My SP3 charger works with this new Surface.Otherwise, the new Surface is pretty much identical to the SP3 and that's not a bad thing.-The best thing about the Surface Pro is the flip-out kickstand. This feature remains just as good with the new Pro and can even fold-out a bit flatter. If you haven't experienced the kickstand before, it is just great. It stores flat on the back, is easy to position, and useful in both the tablet and laptop mode.-The next best thing about the Surface Pro is the optional docking keyboard. It is very easy to attach and detach the keyboard. The thickness of the keyboard is not much more than a few sheets of paper which makes it easy to store in a backpack.-The charging cable and brick are fairly compact which is nice for portability. It connects with a magnet which is reliable and durable.OVERALLThe new Surface Pro is a minor upgrade on the already great older models. It works well as a tablet and as a portable laptop with the keyboard cover.",1
"Do not hesitate in buying this pc . It is so much more practical in the business world when you’re constantly on the go, not having to slug around a full size laptop. Get the premium keyboard and pen with this laptop. Well worth it.",1
Fabulous!!!,1
"Great for work. I bought this specifically to support my automation design side gig. It really helps me take notes at customers facilities and record accurate measurements to then turn into 3D models. Now with that being said, it cant support the high end modeling packages. But I wouldnt expect it to. Its a great field tool and will get extensive use. I use it frequently at home to replace my laptop as well. Light games (havent tried more than civ 5), word processing, email, notes, drawing for fun, and that kind of thing.",1
"After years with an ipad and Samsung Note, this machine rocks.  I love this thing.  It is literally a pc in a tablet.  And MS store people and policy beats apple like a rented mule.  I loaded it up with office and all the apps I need, so it really is a copy of my desktop.",0
"Upgraded from my Surface Pro 4, I broke it, and the new one has been working great. All my Pro 4 accessories, keyboard, pens, docking, all work without problems.",1
"I like the Surface Pro a lot more than I thought I would.  I had random Hibernation problems the first few weeks, but Microsoft has updated and I do not have the issue any more.  Great for travel.",1
Works very well. Pretty sure it was brand new. The price was fantastic. I bought this as an intro to digital art. Very pleased! (heads up; good luck changing the lock screen picture),0
This is just what I need. Im still learning but so far the best purchase I've made.,1
my 4GB basic model was lagging with multiple windows and spreadsheet open.  This one has solved all my problems.  the speed difference is life changing,1
Very happy with the hardware.  Windows 10 ok.,1
"I like the ease of use and the portability. I did need to buy a docking station, a separate connector for my monitor, and a DVD drive. Works nicely with my wireless ScanSnap and wireless Brother printer. Windows 10 made quick work of setting up the wireless connections. I am still staggering from the money bleed, but in a year, I think I will be hooked. You can use a current keyboard and mouse so you don't have to buy the type cover (but I did).",1
"Love, love, love this Surface Pro! It's light years better than the Surface Pro 3 I had a few years ago. I use it all the time!",1
"Excellent product, was received as described, was delivered at the correct time.",1
"My Surface 4 (4GB RAM) exploded due to a battery malfunction, and MS was only able to offer an identical replacement for $450. I'm grateful that I was able to get this replacement with twice the RAM, at such a good price!",1
I already have a Surface 3 that will not update to Win 10 and has terrible battery life. But need a Windows 10 laptop/tablet that is light and easy to travel with. I work in IT Service and Support and need to have latest tech with me to support customers. So far I really like this new Surface. Starts up quickly. Has great battery life.  And the screen quality is amazing.Next I need to see if I can build a virtual machine on it.,1
"I only use my Surface for digital drawing with a Surface Pen in Photoshop CC 2019, and so far it has worked mostly great! I bought the I5 with 8 gigs of RAM, and I would say that is the absolute minimum specs I would go for, for heavy Photoshop usage. Depending on what I am doing, PS will lag a bit at times.  Battery life is OK, I can get maybe 4 or 5 hours out of a charge.  Drawing on this screen is NOT true to life, but it is super milky smooth and I love it.  I need the screen to be pretty bright when I'm drawing, which of course burns more battery. I feel like the standard screen brightness setting is not enough.Before I bought this I was worried that the stand wouldn't be good enough, but it is great, I love it.Another thing I appreciate is that this tablet comes with much less bloatware than, say, your standard Dell laptop.Speakers are nothing to write home about, not surprisingly.I will update this review as I use this tablet more.",1
"I first have to say that I did not purchase my Surface Pro through Amazon. However, Amazon is pretty much the most popular place to read reviews before purchasing items. So I'm posting my review here, in hopes it helps others make their decision.First the obvious. The device looks and feels like a premium item. The vent slots around the top edge are even less visible than on the previous model (Surface pro 4). Even though the edges are slightly rounder on the new version, I would not have noticed unless told about it.My core i5 model is fan-less, meaning COMPLETELY silent. You will not hear a peep out of this device. Definitely an improvement from the previous generation.I'm pleasantly surprised at how cool to the touch the device stays, even after hours of uninterrupted use. Definitely on par, or better than my ipad slim. I bought mine during my lunch hour from work. I came back to the office, plugged it in and ran through initial set up.The device was at about 40% charge when I pulled it out of the box. I then charged it to 100%, and proceeded to time the beginning, and end time for every use session. This way I could accurately measure the real world battery life with normal use.I used it for a total of 5 sessions in the first 24 hours, and got 6 1/2 hours of actual use time. In that time, I read and replied to e-mails, downloaded and set up all office 365 applications, played around in Onenote, then sketched with the pen for about an hour, watched a couple of hours of youtube videos, imported and tweaked some spreadsheets in Excel, used the pen to work out lots of math problems and used it to make several Amazon purchases. Then, when the device was down to about 3% battery, I charged it again for the second time. This time I turned off the keyboard's back light, because I'm a touch typist, and rarely look at my keyboard even when in almost complete dark. I then clicked on the battery icon, and changed the device settings to ""Recommended"". To my surprise, the device only marginally dimmed the screen brightness, but the result was that on my second charge, I got abut 8 1/2 hours of use. I could even go lower on the settings to ""Best Battery Life"", and it would probably push it to about 10 hours of use. I just choose NOT to do that, because then my display would be too dark to be enjoyable.The device keeps its charge intact when turned off, and inside my messenger bag for several hours every day.After the 3rd full charge, I am getting consistently, between 6.5 to 8.5 hours, depending on what software I'm running.I suspect that those manipulating large 3D creations in zbrush, or modo, will definitely see less battery hours than I.The kick stand is slightly less rigid than on the surface pro 4, but I see no wobble or any reason to feel insecure about it.The only reason I took 1 star from this review, is that after one week of use, now I have spotted a small point (The size of half a drop of water) on the screen, where I can see some faint back light bleed when on a completely black screen. Again, I can ONLY see it during the all black boot up screen, or if I REALLY look for it while watching movies with dark backgrounds, while on a room with all lights turned off. I cannot see this spot on any other circumstance. It is so faint, that I can't see it, even if I look for it during normal use. I'm a hard nitpicker, and probably would have thought about exchanging my unit, if I had noticed this the first day. But now that all my accounts are synched, I've downloaded all my applications and installed all my personal files on here... the hassle is not worth it. So, PLEASE check your screen as SOON as you boot it up for the first time, and you should be golden.To end on a happy note, I have to say that for a few days, I really contemplated getting the new Ipad pro instead of the surface pro.If you are a digital artist who ONLY wants a portable digital sketchbook, and you do NOT require the device for any serious work... then the ipad pro is probably the best option for you. Simply because the ipad pencil has a lower initial activation force for the pen. This makes it feel more natural when drawing. However, writing on either device feels quite similar. After a few days of comparisons, I had to move up to the Macbook pro as an alternative, because the ipad pro just didn't measure up to my personal and professional needs. But then I realized that the new Macbooks have NO legacy USB 3.0 ports, no Micro SD card slot, and only 2 USB C type ports. Welcome to dongles galore! I need my device to be as portable as possible. Having to carry around several adapter cables and dongles would really put a strain on my already cluttered bag. Not to mention that I would only be able to afford the 128GB model, which I know for sure is not enough for my needs. The 256GB on my surface pro, coupled with the ability to keep a 128gb SD cart permanently inserted in it for extra space, was just too good to pass up. Then I realized I would also lose the touch screen, and digital pen capabilities if I went with the Macbook pro. Next, the software compatibility issues between the MAC OS and some of the learning software that I use, meant that I would still have to install Windows on a partition of my Macbook pro. Then I would have to start dealing with itunes for my videos and audio files. No. Just NO. Too many negatives crept in, to the point where I felt that the Surface Pro was really tailor made for people like myself.In my case, I wanted a portable device that I could use not just for fun. But that I could use to take notes and draw graphs and images during lectures; use in work meetings as a digital white board while hooked to a projector; work out math/physics problems without having to waste paper; use to manipulate CAD or Photoshop images while on the go; compile and share PDFs or any other format work/school related documents, while having the ability to mark them up, highlight and share them easily; use for coding/programming; and that as an added bonus, could be used as a fun machine for watching movies and drawing/painting on the go.If you want a thin, sleek device that can REALLY replace your laptop, then the Surface Pro is the definite winner.In short, if you want an ultra portable device optimized for content creation, get the Surface Pro.If you want a portable device optimized for content consumption, then get the Ipad Pro.I have owned multiple phones, laptops, game consoles, portable game devices, both work and gaming computers etc...I'm so happy with this device, that this is the first time I have felt compelled to write a review for an electronic device ever.Good luck with your search.",1
The only computer I'll ever buy again. This is my second Pro and I love it.,1
Battery lasts forever!  Highlt recommend this.,1
"Love it! This device replaced my original Surface Pro 3. Very fast, very lightweight. Great design. This is my primary computer, and it does everything well. Can't run high end games (1GB video RAM), but it runs the ones I like (Rocket League and Cuphead) well, along with some others.",0
Product arrived on time. Factory sealed. Started up no problem.,1
"I'm a college engineering student and very pleased with my purchase.  It was beautifully designed and I don't regret spending a little more than usual for this.My main concern in my laptop search was that my old laptop was just too heavy.  I wanted something lightweight to do work on wherever I stopped on campus.  I am not a fan of plain old tablets for that use so this definitely did the trick. It's the perfect combination between laptop and tablet.I really love being able to comfortably type, or quickly detach the keyboard and have a lightweight tablet to draw my notes on using the Surface pen. I am satisfied with the picture and sound quality and battery life.The only downside I would say is the lack of ports on the Surface. You get a charging port, only one USB port, and a mini-display port.  This has not been a problem for me with how I use it but is something to consider.  You can buy a mini-display to HDMI convert for only $6 so I have no issues with the ports so far.",0
BETTER THAN I EXPECTED! highly recommend the surface pro and from amazon,1
Very happy. Item as described. So far so good!,1
"As usual, the Windows experience is quirky. If you're coming from Apple, you'll notice it.I like the expanded functionality of the Pro tablet. I'm using the Surface Pro cover, and run AutoCAD LT 2018 with a 27"" 4k monitor off this little wonder and am quite pleased with the performance.Windows tends to lose peripherals, and does so but not too bad. So I fault the OS for this and not the tablet.Also, at the price, this is a very spendy tablet and is much more of a full featured PC (sans drives and slots). Runs cool. Has great battery life. Highest resolution per inch of any tablet I've used so far.",1
I did a lot of research on laptops/two-in-one tablets before deciding on the Surface Pro 2017.  Many of the online reviews I watched seemed to be favorable of the surface pro therefore I pulled the trigger and purchased it.  The i5/4gb/128SSD is the 2nd surface i purchased after initially buying the core M3 model and deciding it was too slow for my computing needs. After a few days with this i5 model I've decided to return it as well.  Here is a list of positives and negatives I found with this particular surface.Pros:DISPLAY is crystal clear (although calibration is required to get more true whites)SPEAKER SOUND QUALITYCPU SPEEDCHARGING is alot quicker than an Ipad Pro.ALCANTARA keyboards have a great typing experience and have backlit keysCons:BACKLIGHT BLEED at the bottom of the screen when it is in landscape mode.  It is only prevalent on the boot up screen since when you are logged into windows the backlight bleed is covered by the black bar at the bottom.SHUTS OFF randomly when actively using.  If you hit the power button it will bring you back to your last screen but still very inconvenient.LAPABILITY it's tough to use on your lap unless you stay in the exact same position otherwise it fallsPRICE the fact you have to buy the keyboard separately for a two-in-one laptop is ridiculousBATTERY LIFE was a bit underwhelming even when not doing computer intensive things.All things considered I do not think surface pro's are worth the $$.,1
Surfaces are working out perfect for what we needed them for!,0
"I needed a new laptop and wanted something with a touch screen I can write on and I couldn't be happier with the Surface. It runs windows 10, which is the operating system I prefer. The SSD starts up super fast. It's incredibly light.  The screen looks great. The accessories are a bit pricey (unless you compare to apple) but I bought the keyboard, pen, and fold able mouse for Surface and I'd recommend them all. The mouse is very optional but very cool and useful, but the trackpad on the keyboard works just as well as any other modern trackpad. I'd recommend the Surface for anyone who carries a laptop around daily for school or work.",1
"This laptop has served me well for the last three years. I bought it as a gift for myself during 2017 holidays and Im writing this review from that same laptop.Believe it or not all my other devices are made by Apple but there is something about this laptop that is making me NOT give up. I use this laptop A LOT and to my surprise the battery is still performing well. I charge it for around 40-50 mins in the morning and it lasts till bedtime.I guess Windows updates have made this laptop more usable. For eg., in one of the previous Windows 10 versions, using YouTube in laptop mode was a nightmare. In the latest version, in laptop mode, YouTube acts just like it would on your phone. Windows updates have been seamless too.This is also my travel companion. With Netflix, you can download movies to watch on flights. With mini-SD card reader you can transfer photos (I also use GoPro then I can transfer them to my laptop with mini-SD card).This is by far the best laptop money can buy. I cannot be more happier.",0
He had problems using my iPad.  Large fingers would have trouble doing things. When I saw this used on the sidelines I knew the fit would be good. He loves it.,1
Actually I like surface more than other OS tablets I prefer windows tablets.,0
"After a little over a week of use, this is one fantastic device.  I am extremely pleased.  Perfect size for portability along with usability, at least for my purposes.  Great screen resolution and seems to run every bit as fast as my Intel i7 powered HP desktop.",1
This thing is amazingly versatile and fast.  I have no complaints other than screen size.  Love it.,1
"I have had several versions of the Surface Pro (SP1, SP3, SP2017 i5 and now SP2017 i7. With the exception of the first, they have all been excellent computers when matched to the right needs. I love the small size and light weight in a genuine Windows computer and really value it’s portability. I use it as a laptop with the keyboard cover, and as a desktop via the Surface docking station (i.e. using an external large monitor and full-sized external keyboard. I love that the screen is touch, but I don't use it as a pure tablet very often. Occasionally, I'll grab the Surface stylus and use it to edit an image in Photoshop, but I also have a 9.7” iPad Pro that I like better as a pure tablet. Overall, it is an excellent device and I highly recommend it.The one extra comment I will make is that I first bought the i5 version of this because I didn’t want the one with the fan. However, the graphics in that version tended to drag a bit when I was using Photoshop. I went ahead and bought this i7 version for the faster GPU (integrated into the CPU) and I have to say that I shouldn't have been worried about the fan. It rarely runs and I never hear it when it does. If you don’t need something that computationally needs the i7 or the faster GPU, then the i5 is perfect. It's more than fast enough for everything else I did, and it gives you more bang for the buck. But if you do need the additional power of the i7, don’t let the fan thing put you off.One last note... I only gave the sound 3 stars. I should clarify that there is nothing wrong with the sound. It's probably as good as you could expect from the tiny speakers in the edge of a tablet. It's not spectacular, but it's fine... as good as my iPad Pro. Still, it's hard to give it five stars just because that would mean it was exceptional and it's not. If you're going to listen to music, you'll want earbuds, headphones or an external speaker.",0
"This surface is small fast and a great laptop replacement.  Easy to setup, fast boot and everything works great.  Very pleased with this purchase. The only issue I have had is the battery it is awesome for movies ( 2 hour movie only uses ~15% of a battery), but when using it in a meeting (Wifi, screen, typing...) the battery life is significantly less.  Maybe 6- 7 hours at most.  I was hoping I could used it all day and then on the airplane home but that is a stretch.  I will play with the settings but have them set now so I should be getting close to maximum life.",1
"Very pleased with Surface Pro 2017 i7, 8gb ram.  Quick set-up and no issues.",1
"This is a fantastic and dependable machine.  Great for on the go! I work in rescue and can have animal adopters fill out applications in real time!  As a writer and DJ, it meets all of my other needs.  Great sound!  I am in love!",1
Great seller highly recommend!!,1
"Upgraded from the older version Surface Pro 4 i7, 8GB to the latest Surface Pro 4 i7, 16GB.  The old one slowed down when 20 Windows were opened with large PDF files and a couple of software were running at the same time.  I love the performance of the new Pro 4 i7, 16GB. It handles the similar situation flawlessly. The lightning speed of the face authentication is awesome!",1
"Do not hesitate in buying this pc . It is so much more practical in the business world when you’re constantly on the go, not having to slug around a full size laptop. Get the premium keyboard and pen with this laptop. Well worth it.",0
Amazing very recommended,1
"I use my SP for everything including writing code, watching Netflix, watching NFL, reading via the Windows Kindle app, making notes in OneNote, editing video in Adobe Premiere Pro. Never had any significant issues. The specs (CPU / RAM, etc) combined with this amazing form factor is the best. Under heavy use, I'd guess I get 4 hours of battery. I regularly have it docked so it rarely gets below 50% battery.",0
"Had a horrible experience with a gen 6 and went back to the gen 5 instead. I now own 4 of these for the wife and kids. Super fast, and runs anything we throw at it",0
"I've had a MacBook pro for the past 7-8 years and the computer has ran flawlessly it's entire life. Recently with all the iOS updates and the constant program updates it would just take way too long to open programs and files so I figured it was time to upgrade. However the computer STILL WORKS so you can imagine that after 8 years my expectations for my new computer are really high.I've seen many commercials and other students using older models of the surface so I figured I would research it and maybe give it a chance. When I checked the specs and saw how powerful this new model is, and compared it to the new MacBook, the surface beat the Mac in almost every category but mainly versitality.So I ended up going with the surface and have only been amazed with it since. Granted it is brand new so it should run flawlessly, but when I loaded it with all my programs and started running multiple applications it still ran just as fast. The touch screen is extremely responsive and the overall picture quality is incredible. Even the tiny speakers can pack a decent punch and allow you to hear the subtle tone differences in music and stereo sound in movies.I am currently a student who is going into corporate sales and I highly recommend the surface to anyone who is doing something similar. The ability to use it as a laptop to develop PowerPoints and spreadsheets, then use it as a tablet to present information or write in additional notes, is beyond convenient and has changed the way I work. And when you pair it with the keyboard and pen (as well as a good case) you can practically do anything.Outside of professional life I also like to play music and also game sometimes so the processing power and video card were a concern to me. However It runs abelton smoothly and has been able to handle any steam game I have installed and run on it. And the ability to connect controllers (Xbox and midi) is flawless and the install is practically plug and play with Windows 10.Overall if you need a powerhouse of a computer but don't feel like carrying around a giant slab of a laptop this is the machine for you. I used to swear by Mac but this surface has made me come over to the dark side and I'm not leaving any time soon :)- case: Kensington black belt/ skin: skinomi carbon fiber",1
"Had a surface pro 3 i5 edition, decided it was time to upgrade so I chose the new surface pro with an i7.The preformance you get in this small package is amazing, and there is the ability to play certain games on this machine such as Skyrim, however I've noticed the device does not charge while doing cpu intensive tasks, might have something to do with the 15 watt power supply.Over all very solid and great machine, priced on the high end but you get what you pay for.",0
Great but have to get various accessories,1
Arrived on time and as advertised.,1
"I'm very amazed with this computer!  I've had it for a little over a year now.  I have another laptop that I use at home.  It's battery ended up going bad, so, I removed the battery and have it docked to a keyboard, mouse, and monitor;  I basically use it as a desktop only at home now.  I needed a computer that I could travel with and use anywhere.  I looked into a few options and decided the to give the Surface a try.  Very glad I did!  I was a bit worried at first.  My other laptop has better specs (i7 processor, 16gb ram, nvidia 860m video card).  This Surface I got has a i5 processor, 4gb ram, and intel 620 graphics.  I almost got the i7 version for the 640 graphics, but, went with the i5 due to the much lower price, and, having no fans and being silent is nice as well.  To my surprise, this computer tackles everything I throw at it!  I don't game much on it, but, the few games I have tried play very well.  What I do that is hardest on this computer is video editing.  I do most my videos in 1080 x 60.  100% smooth editing, as good as my more powerful computer at home!  Rendering times aren't bad either.  A little slower than my other computer, but, not too much really.  My cameras can record in 4k as well, but, I rarely use that (it just takes a lot longer to render, video files are much larger, and few people even watch in 4k).  But, I had to at least try it!  So, I threw in some 4k video in to my video editor; again to my surprise, it is smooth and handles the 4k video files just fine!  Amazing!  Rendering times of course increase.  I can now travel anywhere with this laptop and my Canon G7x Mark ii and / or Canon SX730 cameras and have everything I need to record, edit, & upload from anywhere!  This laptop does everything I need, and, should do everything I need for many years to come!To anyone thinking of getting a Surface laptop, I'd also suggest looking into other keyboard options.  Yes, their keyboard is nice, but, also expensive!  I got an Anker brand bluetooth keyboard that is small and light; and, a small wireless Logitech mouse.  Of course I also bought a 13"" laptop bag that will hold everything.  I got the bag, mouse, and keyboard for less than half the price of just the Surface keyboard!",1

"I purchased this for general use and work.  The core m surface is fast enough and opens documents. and other programs really quick.  Everything is built into the tablet, so don't expect to be able to swap the ssd out easily.  It is possible to swap out the sad but would void the warranty.  The touch screen responds perfect and have yet to have issues with the surface keyboard/cover attachment I bought separately. I reviewed this product ocer the galaxy tab s3 and apple iPad.  I solely bought this because of the speed and other devices we have in the home for integration purposes.  If I was an apple enthusiasts, I would have bought the ipad.  The reason I did not choose the galaxy tab s3 was due to the clunky keyboard/cover and applications available on it.",0
Great for light work and meetings,1
"This is the best computer I have ever purchased. Tablet sized yet all of the benefits of a Windows OS. Touch screen, great accessories, battery lasts a long time.",1
Excellent purchase,1
"The main advantages of this over a laptop are the smaller size, fully Windows compatible, and better battery life over a tablet.I recommend getting the type cover and Surface Pen to really use the Surface to its full capabilities.  This is my first Surface Pro and the pen absolutely is worth it; it's very intuitive for sketching and jotting down notes.  Even for browsing it feels more natural than a mouse or touchpad.  This thing is an absolute pleasure to use, and the fan-less i5 core is speedy and quiet.It charges relatively quickly, but a USB-C connection for faster charges would make it even better.",1
"I have yet to find a single thing wrong with it besides the lack of scaling unrelated to the Surface. The touch works great, and it completely replaced my gaming laptop. As a matter of fact I'm getting rid of the gaming laptop now. This 2 in 1 does it all. I got the i5 256GB just to meet some of my gaming needs but this wasn't meant to game. Gaming however, is surprisingly good. I haven't tried anything hard than League but in League I get a consistent 60FPS on medium-low and I'll drop to 30-45 FPS in big scuffles. One thing I do wish for future models is USB-C at the very least and in a perfect world, Thunderbolt 3. Overall I get the purpose. Its the ideal daily rig for on the go. Great battery life and great screen.",1
"fast efficient, amazing pen response- better than my cintiq. runs surprisingly  cool for I7 16gb ram model. Just wish it had usb-c but not a deal breaker for me",0
"Upgraded from my Surface Pro 4, I broke it, and the new one has been working great. All my Pro 4 accessories, keyboard, pens, docking, all work without problems.",0
No problems so far!,0
"Great shipping, after going through other laptops all of them were terrible. I finally gave in and bought the surface pro 5, which I used at my last job and loved. It is ABSOLUTELY worth it, pair it with the amazon insurance and bam. It's cheaper than microsoft and the warranty is better for a cheaper price!!!",1
"Excelent performance. The Surface with these characteristics is enough for Office, web browsing and basic software development. I am also using OneDrive to store basically all my important files. ObeDrive works perfectly and as a whole the machine works really great.",1
Great product that exceeds my expectations.,1
"I bought a surface pro for my wife about a year ago and was so delighted with it, I had to buy one for myself.  The facial recognition feature works great.  There is hardly any delay between the time the sensor(s) are activated and when you're into the desktop.  I'm very pleased with my purchase.",0
"It’s great! More than I expected, so glad I decided for this hibrid! By far a supirior machine!",1
Not much I can say here. I freaking love this thing (and I was an all Apple person before deciding to buy it).,0
"The description states a 3.5 GHz processor but it is only 2.7 GHz. Either way, it serves its purpose. It is fast, reliable and far more useful than a desktop for what I need.",1
"Excellent computer for general purpose work.  I am working with the i7 with 1TB of storage - I bought the Pro 4 with i5 and 256GB and rapidly realized I under-purchased for my work.The good (ok great):Fast - the i7 Surface Pro is significantly snappier than the i5 of 2015.  Maybe 2 to 2.5x as fast at standard jobs. I'm running some multi-media jobs to benchmark this weekend and will post a followup.Storage - very fast.  Files open and close with ""snap"".The screen is just as excellent as the Pro 4, and that's what got me to switch most of my computing from a MacBook Air to the Pro line. The screen is gorgeous.The fingerprint reading on the touch keyboard (recommended option) is much faster and more accurate. This tells me that there must be CPU processing involved in fingerprint sensing accuracy as I just switched the same keyboard from the Pro 4 to the Pro 2017.Cooling - I noticed the Pro 2017 just doesn't heat up as much as the Pro 4 at any task.Surface Dock - Truly outstanding accessory. Just hook up the magnetic connector and add monitor, ethernet, sound, and more USB-3 to the job.  I use it with a very high resolution Dell display and it's stunning.MixedThe battery - it's significantly longer lasting at the same brightness as the Pro 4 - but I still get about 5-7 hours of useful life. That's at ""suggested"" or ""brighter"" settings. I don't use brightest - it's just wasteful.  Battery life could still be better, but it is pretty much good enough for my needs.Wish ListUSB-C.  I of course didn't expect it, but Microsoft could have upgraded the USB 3.0 to latest spec and added a USB-C to the Pro 2017. Really, it's not badness (I'm not deducting a star) but seriously why not?All in all, this is more than a solid performer. It's a stylish, good-looking outstanding performer that is suitable for any road warrior or any desk.  This is an excellent followup to the already great Pro 4.",1
I love my new Surface pro 2017 core i5 with 8gb Ram and 256 gb SSD. Before I had Surface Pro 1 and I loved it. There are not so many differences in the sofware but The new Alcantara keyboard is lovely. The portability and the battery time are very important things and you can run a lot of videos and the surface will not get hot as the others,0
"Said it in the title wish I had one home, great on the go great to present on.",1
Very happy with the purchase. 1st of all the seller was excellent. Ensured me that the product is authentic and brand new and replied to all my queries. Product is indeed brand new and was registered with 1 year warranty through microsoft website. Props tp seller. Amazon did ship the item quickly and handled international shipping with zero import fee deposit. The product has been great so far. Best 2 in 1 device I have ever used and has been such a companion for my academic work and business work.,1
"This surface is small fast and a great laptop replacement.  Easy to setup, fast boot and everything works great.  Very pleased with this purchase. The only issue I have had is the battery it is awesome for movies ( 2 hour movie only uses ~15% of a battery), but when using it in a meeting (Wifi, screen, typing...) the battery life is significantly less.  Maybe 6- 7 hours at most.  I was hoping I could used it all day and then on the airplane home but that is a stretch.  I will play with the settings but have them set now so I should be getting close to maximum life.",0
good computereasy to carry,1
This is one of my favorite computers I have ever owned. Touchscreen is beautiful. Size and weight are perfect for traveling and the pen opens up a whole new world for creative work. Powerful enough to run all my Adobe software. I might never buy a laptop again.,0
"I purchased the Surface Pro i5 8GB RAM.The unit is taking the place of both a HP ultrabook and an IPad. The ultrabook is still a good laptop and performs well, however this Surface Pro has exceeded all of my expectations. It has been a great purchase and I love working on it on a daily basis. I bought a keyboard for it as well, which has made it a true pleasure to use. It easily runs circles around both my ultrabook (which I love) and the IPad.The Surface Pro is built very well, from both the perspective of actual construction and initial durability, as well as design. The speakers being front facing work very well, better than any laptop or tablet I have listened to.The screen itself is beautiful with excellent clarity and detail, with the speed behind its supporting hardware to display anything I have thrown at it. Touch-screen action, speed and response are excellent.Saying the processor is very good is an understatement. Fan-less and very fast; it handles video compression, editing, and encoding better than any I have used, especially considering the small form factor. Simpler editing and any other daily computer use tasks aren't even really worth mentioning because it easily does those concurrently as the heavy tasks. Absolutely wonderful.Battery life has been exceptional. Coming from an ultrabook which has good battery life, the Surface Pro has been amazing. I am on it all day and it has no problem running on and on.The Surface Pro is on the expensive side, however, I can say that in comparison with any other tablet or laptop on the market, this is by far the superior product, in nearly all aspects. Years ahead in development, hardware, and support. It is truly a pleasure to use.I suppose what tops it all off is its extremely small and portable size. Keep in mind that this isn't just a tablet, like ""competitor products"". This is an actual, fully capable computer, which can be easily thrown in a backpack or simply carried. It really has no competition because it outperforms everything else. I know I will love this Surface Pro for years to come.Some people may say that it doesn't have USB Type-C. True, but do I really want to go out and re-purchase all the things I have, just so they can be USB-C based hardware? No; not only would this be expensive for little to no realistic gain, but all of the things I have already work well and I plan on getting use out of my purchases. Plus, most hardware doesn't support USB-C yet anyway; it hasn't been made yet. Lastly, from what I understand, Microsoft plans on selling a Surface Connect-Type C converter just in case you need it, which will support both full data and full Type-C power. Both points of full data and power being important, as many current Type-C ports and hardware are not actually fully capable.After having the Surface Pro a few weeks, I am extremely happy with it. You won't regret it if you get one.",1
Well i just got this and started using it it seems to be a good product my only concern is ive noticed what seems like screen flickering a bit or its dimming a bit when i type only noticed this when it was off the charger so who knows may be nothing. I will update this review later,1
"Amazing Product. It's a bit pricey, but as they say, you get what you pay for.Build quality is Supreme. the magnesium alloy body feels great to touch and very sturdy. the kickstand also has the same quality: it can be easily rotated but also keeps its position; just on the sweet stiffness spot.As for the UI, it's very fluent. Windows is well-integrated with this pc.Speakers: wow!Fans (i7): almost silent, kicked in only once while installing an update, and never heard them since.The only drawback I find is the ports. u know, an extra USB type C (which is way better than the Mini DisplayPort) wouldn't harm anyone, but a dock should solve this issue (not necessarily Microsoft's).Other than that this is a great PC. I totally Recommend.",0
"--UPDATE--Disabling the auto screen brightness feature seems to correct the below issue.The device will reset at random times. It doesn’t seem to matter what I’m doing. After a review on reddit , I found many early adopters are experiencing the same issue. See thread: “Suspend/Poweroff at Random Surface Pro 2017 i5”.--Original Review--Received my Surface Pro yesterday and used it all evening. Here are my initial thoughts, hope they help.My device Intel Core i7, 8GB RAM, 256GB, coming from an Ipad Pro.Pros:1. It’s a full PC. If it works on PC, It works on this.2. Ease of use. I love how it easy it is to load UHD video files. Playback is flawless. Never did get this working on Ipad.3. Fast and responsive.4. Build quality is premium. Love the new rounded edges.5. Near silent. It has a fan, but it’s not loud enough to remember it’s even there. I think the i5 doesn’t even have one.6. Battery life is really good. Again I haven’t done any official tests, but it lasted all evening on the “out of the box” charge.7. Screen resolution is crisp and bright. Looks great playing hi res videos.8. Expandable storage with a micro SD card. This is a no brainer. Get a clue Apple.9. USB port. Again, Apple WTF?Cons:1. I wish the bezel was a little thinner. It would be nice to have more screen real-estate.2. A little smaller than ipad pro.3. It gets a little warm. Not sure about thermal throttling. I haven’t tested.  But it does get a bit warm holding in your hands after a while.4. While I was browsing the web, it lockup and screen went black, after a few seconds it auto reset. This happened just once. Didn’t happen again all night.Conclusion:I really love it. This is the device the Ipad Pro should have been. This is a truly awesome laptop replacement and I enjoy using it. The most versatile portal tablet on the market.",0

"This unit was replacing an Asus 2 in 1 tablet with several years in service so my wife is not inexperienced user of this kind of devices. After several months in use she is still excited about how good her Surface Pro is. I had been asking frequently about any cons she could found but still nothing had disliked her and I still receive full credit by the gift selection. So in short, great device for an experience diverse user, and I'm thinking about to get a replacement for my Surface 3.",0
"I regret buying a model that doesn't include a type C port, but other than that, this baby works like a dream. I use it as an ultraportable between school and work. I also use the cobalt surface pen to write on the screen while I tutor students over the internet. The battery usually lasts me a week if I use it lightly and shut it down between uses. The hardware isn't for gamers, but it runs Cuphead perfectly.",1
"Love it it’s small portable and fast. With blue beam it’s great for stations, plants and refinery P&ID walk downs and start ups, or what’re you other people do 😎",0
"Great product at a great price, super fast device and easy to setup and go.",1
"an iPAD killer if I have ever seen one. Really nice screen, fast, excellent keyboard and a pleasure to use.",0
I was unsure about spending this much on the Surface but did it anyways.  I could not be more happy with my purchase.  I have docking stations at my home and office so I can run two extra screens at a time. The quality and speed are great. No lag between screens. I run two 27inch screens with high quality. Best purchase ever. Iv had this product for two years and have had no problems. I save everything to the cloud so my computer dont get full of junk.  Seriously I'm not sure if I said it or not but I'm extremely happy with my purchase,1
"$2400 for a ""1TB SSD"" that's not really a 1TB SSD - BUYER BEWARE.Microsoft is cutting corners on these devices by installing 2x 512GB SSDs and running them in proprietary RAID 0. The Windows OS does not recognize the SSDs AS SSDs and views the RAID 0 array as a HARD DRIVE; rendering TRIM inoperable and useless. If just ONE of these two drives has the slightest issue, your Surface becomes an expensive paperweight and your data vanishes into thin air.HIGHLY recommend running cloud based backup software with these devices if you're saving information locally that's critical to you. Unbelievably underhanded and dishonest practice by Microsoft; will be scrutinizing all MS device purchase with extreme caution as a result, moving forward.",1
"Awesome! I wish I had purchased one MUCH sooner! In addition to all the great features and ease of use, I especially like that I can keep it powered on during airline flights from gate to gate. It is not considered a ""larger portable electronic device,"" so I do not have to power it down or stow it. This allows me to make good use of all the available on a flight.",1
The only computer I'll ever buy again. This is my second Pro and I love it.,0
"I bought it for my wife who wanted ""an iPad"".  I convinced her to buy a real computer.  Now that I have it, I love it so much, we are fighting over who gets to use it :-).  Now if I could only convince my boss to get me one of these for work ...",1
"I'm so happy I ordered from these guys, i was going to america for a week and i saw that i could save €600 by ordering from these guys, I was sceptical at first but they assured me it was brand new and I've been using it non stop for the past 6 months, brilliant product, made college life so much easier",1
Great alternative if you like laptop capabilities for a small size. Delivery was seamless. Package came very quick and in good stare,1
"Beautiful to look at, beautiful to hold and a wonderful working experience.  The Surface Pro is certainly a laptop to behold.  You will get complimentary stares and comments everywhere you use the device.  The experience from unboxing to setting up is exceptional... though like with all devices the updates are painful.  Only negative is that the Surface Pro keyboard and pen needs to be purchased separately, but there's enough gripe on the internet about this point - though I think it goes unnoticed by Microsoft.  Nonetheless, if you take the plunge, you will have to get the keyboard and depending on what you intend using the device for, the pen is really optional.",1

Love it!  Easy to use and works great!,1
I was tired of having a tablet and a laptop. This is a perfect combination of the two. Between the stylus and the full fledged Windows OS it does everything you could ask for.,0
He had problems using my iPad.  Large fingers would have trouble doing things. When I saw this used on the sidelines I knew the fit would be good. He loves it.,0
"I was reluctant before buying it because everybody said it was a tablet and it was similar to IPad Pro. Well let me tell you that the machine is looking waaay slimmer than other laptops in it's range and here I was comparing it most with Dell XPS 13"".Working for a banking institution I'm using it to finish my reports at home and also work during weekend on it and I am super delighted to work on it being so easy to carry around and use. The power it's also great never had any errors or troubles with it. I like it a lot!",0
"Works  well and uses the  window 10 pro software. - Good solid, stable  tablet.",1
Love the Surface Pro and can hardly wait to take it on speaking trips!,1
"Amazing product. I can’t speak highly enough about it. The software and hardware work really well together. Microsoft did a really good job with the touchscreen and with the surface pen, drawling on this thing works really well. This is well worth the price.",0

Can't say enough good things about this product. it does everything I need and then some,1
"I love it. It was a great deal! Just what I needed. My only concern was for a moment my touchscreen stopped working, but I restarted it and haven't had a problem since.",1
"Very good, Thank you.",1
It's a computer it's a tablet it is fantastic. If your thinking about getting an iPad your better off getting this.,1
Greatest tablet I ever had,1
"I almost got a macbook because I am an iPhone user. However due to Mac's crazy prices, I got a surface. I absolutely love it, and it even syncs all my photos from my iPhone. the sketch apps are amazing and the touch sensitivity is almost that of using pen and paper. Well worth the money, one of my best purchases ever.",0
"Solid 4/5 stars.Pros:-Great screen: the touchscreen is responsive and the ppi density is 267, which is far better than most regular laptops, let alone touchscreen ones.-Good battery life: After over 2 years, the Surface Pro still works really well. I've used it heavily for online college classes, internet browsing, and video playback, and the battery still lasts about 8 hours depending on what it's being used for.-Good processing speed: I regularly have well over 50 tabs open at a time for research paper sources, news articles I want to read later, etc., and I've only ever had one instance where the computer or browser froze. [That said, it's not the faster laptop either, and The Sims 4 (and presumably similar games) has to be set at the lowest settings in order to run without glitching, or overheating the laptop. Small or older games like Among Us and Insaniquarium run with no issues.]-Power cord: The cord is magnetic, so it won't damage the laptop or itself if it gets pulled out unexpectedly, and it won't pull the laptop off of a table if someone trips on it.-Surface pen: the surface pen makes it very easy to use drawing programs. Have not had any issues with the pen at all.-Keyboard: the keyboard is responsive and the fabric coating has lasted far better than I thought it would. I have the silver/gray color and you'd barely know it's not brand new.Cons:-Headphone jack: the headphone jack has always been a bit buggy (the audio doesn't always switch to headphones when they are inserted), and as of last Friday, after 2 years and 3 months, the headphone jack no longer works at all, no matter what set of headphones is used with it.-Power cord: Very occasionally the laptop won't register that it's plugged in, and it has to be restarted to get it to charge.-No disk drive and no expandable storage.Overall this laptop is great as a college laptop, as a drawing tablet, or for very light games. I would not recommend this to anyone who wants to run more demanding games, or to anyone who wanted to do heavy video editing.",1
I love this thing. The perfect laptop on the go with just enough performance.,1
I love my surface pro! The new model was out of my price range but the 5th gen fits my needs perfectly. Excellent purchase,1
as expected.  I mainly use this as a reader.  I considered epaper devices but the ability to use Adobe Acrobat (and it's search functions) and external USB drives made the final choice for me.,0
"I was looking for a small but reliable laptop. While the price was a bit more than I wanted to pay, it’s a great value and I’m happy with it. I was a bit skiddish of going tablet with keyboard but this worry proved to be nothing. I’ve found the Pro to be big enough and fast enough to do what I needed.",0
"I love this surface pro! It's not super big and heavy, it's just perfect size. It's also great for school or work. It came in it's original box, sealed and safely packed. I love the charger, it has a magnetic type connection, so as soon as you put it close to the surface pro, it pulls it to connect. Nice! Overall I like it and recommend it! Ps: you don't really need the keyboard.",0
"This is a classic ""you get what you pay for"" sort of situation. I purchased the m3 model with 4GB of RAM for a little under $600. This thing is great: it's portable, high-quality, stylish, and seems durable enough, but it's performance lags compared to my other laptops. If I had sprung for the i5 with 8 GB model, I'm sure I would have nothing to complain about, but I couldn't justify pretty much doubling what I was going to spend.Sure, you can't have 18 Chrome tabs open with Excel running while you watch a Twitch Stream--but you can do anything a normal college student would require of a laptop.",0
"I use my SP for everything including writing code, watching Netflix, watching NFL, reading via the Windows Kindle app, making notes in OneNote, editing video in Adobe Premiere Pro. Never had any significant issues. The specs (CPU / RAM, etc) combined with this amazing form factor is the best. Under heavy use, I'd guess I get 4 hours of battery. I regularly have it docked so it rarely gets below 50% battery.",1
have had this for a week and so far i like it a lot. i bought this to do my school stuff when i cant be on my PC. only bad thing i can say about it is no USB C. 1x USB A and a display adapter which i have never used before. if you want more USB ports then i suggest getting a USB hub. Overall very nice machine. it is very responsive and very light. the windows hello is a cool feature that I've never used before and pretty sure the government has my face now LOL.,0
"I absolutely love this computer. I bought it prior to my first semester in law school. I waited until after first semester to write a review to see how it held up to daily use. It is still going strong. It also works well with the glitchy ExamSoft software we are required to use for exams.The battery life is fantastic. Although I brought my charger to class every day, I only had to charge the computer when I got home at night.",0

"This is, by far, the best purchase I've made when it comes to computers. I wanted to buy this product for my video editing. I had a desktop that was powerful enough to do the editing that I needed done, however I struggled to do my edits when my desktop was in a place away from the rest of my family and I couldn't move it. I decided to go with the Surface Pro, i5, because it would do the basics. Once I started using the Surface, I quickly realized that it would do more than just the basics. This is certainly my go-to computer now. I love editing pictures and video on it with Adobe software, I love surfing the internet with it and I love using it to take notes on various different things. I did purchase the Surface refurbished, and I'm so happy I did. I also bought accessories that were not Microsoft. Doing these two things saved me between $300-$400 total and I wouldn't change any of that at this point.I wanted to give it some time before I posted my review. I've had it for nearly two months and I absolutely love it. It's still the easiest laptop to carry around and work on. It also does the job I need it to do, no matter what that is. I remember someone in college bragging about this computer and I laughed at them, thinking they were crazy for choosing this over some other laptop. While I'm glad I waited for this particular model, I am SO thankful I purchased it! Definitely the best decision I've made for my video editing.",0
"Had a surface pro 3 i5 edition, decided it was time to upgrade so I chose the new surface pro with an i7.The preformance you get in this small package is amazing, and there is the ability to play certain games on this machine such as Skyrim, however I've noticed the device does not charge while doing cpu intensive tasks, might have something to do with the 15 watt power supply.Over all very solid and great machine, priced on the high end but you get what you pay for.",1
I love it very much,1
absolutely love it!,1
"This is my third Surface Pro unit.  I upgraded from a Surface 3 to a Surface 4 to the 2017 Surface Pro.  All were i7 tablets and I had no issues with any of them.  This one, as the others, has a beautiful screen, boots up quickly and runs quite fast.  It's definitely the best of the three I've owned. This is my go to travel unit due to it's size and weight.  I also purchased a new alcantra keyboard which also works quite well.  It's a little pricey but worth it to me because of it versatility.  I highly recommend it.",1
Wow.  Just wow.  This unit has as much power as a laptop and is so portable.  Will never go back to laptop.,1
"I got this to replace my dying Surface 3. The battery on that was getting worse and worse, so I decided that instead of going to some other manufacturer or platform, I would stay with Microsoft and get this model. What a terrible mistake I've made. My first touch cover was absolutely worthless. I wasn't able to set up Windows because the touch cover was broken. So I got it replaced and the replacement has had issues with the trackpad not working half the time. I can drag and drop files around, but the trackpad will cut off half the time, leaving my files in the wrong folder, program, or just nowhere at all. So if I want to do anything productive I am forced to use either the touchscreen (The Windows 10 Tablet Mode is something I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy) or I have to get a bluetooth mouse to use that. The keyboard is perfectly fine and one of the best laptop keyboards I've used. But not being able to use half of the inputs on the type cover is unacceptable.",1
"Quick and lightweight.  Highest res makes text a little small, but that can be adjusted.  That said, lots of screen space in a small package.",1
Love the mobility and ease of use.,1
"This is an awesome computer. Works well as a pad, the screen is responsive to the touch or a pen. I added the hub for the office, use two screens, a mouse, and keyboard, and it's perfect. Great.",1
"This was an upgrade from the Surface Pro 3 and is exactly what I was hoping it would be!  Not a drastic change overall, but a solid computing machine.  Windows 10 and the Surface family of products have really made Microsoft relevant again.  I've not had any issues with blue screens or battery drain.  Touch input is great.  Would definitely buy again and recommend to others!",1
"I like the ease of use and the portability. I did need to buy a docking station, a separate connector for my monitor, and a DVD drive. Works nicely with my wireless ScanSnap and wireless Brother printer. Windows 10 made quick work of setting up the wireless connections. I am still staggering from the money bleed, but in a year, I think I will be hooked. You can use a current keyboard and mouse so you don't have to buy the type cover (but I did).",0
I already have a Surface 3 that will not update to Win 10 and has terrible battery life. But need a Windows 10 laptop/tablet that is light and easy to travel with. I work in IT Service and Support and need to have latest tech with me to support customers. So far I really like this new Surface. Starts up quickly. Has great battery life.  And the screen quality is amazing.Next I need to see if I can build a virtual machine on it.,0
"The most fast, powerful and elegant tablet on Windows 10 for office purposes!",1
have had this for a week and so far i like it a lot. i bought this to do my school stuff when i cant be on my PC. only bad thing i can say about it is no USB C. 1x USB A and a display adapter which i have never used before. if you want more USB ports then i suggest getting a USB hub. Overall very nice machine. it is very responsive and very light. the windows hello is a cool feature that I've never used before and pretty sure the government has my face now LOL.,1
Had to replace SP3 when screen glass cracked (still use it but no touchscreen now). Even better than the original... great!,1
Bought so i can run clip studio on it Works perfect!! Fast shipping!,1
Surface Pro with i7 performs perfectly for either work or personal use. I have all the apps i need for work (office 365) Plus games such as Starcraft 2 for personal.  it loads without issues and minimal lag time.  battery would last for 6 hours while working which is enough for me,1
"I bought this to replace an infuriating Samsung Work Book (soon will have to be smashed and recycled).  Surface Pro is amazing.  First time I have experienced a computer set itself up and work, right-out of the box.  Probably what Mac users keep raving about...but you don't have to own a Mac!  I don't have anything that I don't like about Surface Pro.  All my normal financial, personal, and work-related routines are functioning just as well, or better than on my desk top.  I will not bother buying the key-board.  Surface Pro travels just fine, and the touch screen performs well for simpler tasks.  I mainly use it at home as my ""wake-up"" and ""evening slow-down"" tool.  I can drink a few cups of coffee by the stove, using Surface Pro on one of those handy lap-desks with a wireless mouse and keyboard.  Perfect!",0
Very fast,1
"Fast, easy to use. Im a full apple user but needed a good portable pc for work since i need some software that only runs on windows. I was considering a macbook with parallels, but the cost, plus software plus the windows license made me look for other options. This is a beautiful machine, fast and simple. No extra software to slow it down, so you get windows at its best. Highly recommend it. Im still an apple user. But credit is given were credit is due.",0
Powerful... I ordered to replace my laptop that I had set up with a docking station.  I did the same for this using my existing keyboard and mouse with the docking station setup.  I also bough the cover/keyboard which in retrospect was a waste.,1
"I've gotten a ton of use out of my Surface Pro 3 (SP3) over the past 3.5 years however the battery life was diminishing rapidly so I decided to upgrade to the new Surface Pro. (I don't know why Microsoft has to confuse everyone by not naming it the Surface Pro 5 but I digress.)Here are the biggest improvements coming from the SP3:-Noticeably thinner and lighter. Makes it easier to handle as a tablet.-Fanless i5 version. Love not having to hear the high-pitched fan.Accessory compatibility:-My SP3 keyboard cover is compatible with this new Surface. Saves me about a hundred bucks.-My SP3 charger works with this new Surface.Otherwise, the new Surface is pretty much identical to the SP3 and that's not a bad thing.-The best thing about the Surface Pro is the flip-out kickstand. This feature remains just as good with the new Pro and can even fold-out a bit flatter. If you haven't experienced the kickstand before, it is just great. It stores flat on the back, is easy to position, and useful in both the tablet and laptop mode.-The next best thing about the Surface Pro is the optional docking keyboard. It is very easy to attach and detach the keyboard. The thickness of the keyboard is not much more than a few sheets of paper which makes it easy to store in a backpack.-The charging cable and brick are fairly compact which is nice for portability. It connects with a magnet which is reliable and durable.OVERALLThe new Surface Pro is a minor upgrade on the already great older models. It works well as a tablet and as a portable laptop with the keyboard cover.",0
"I purchased this tablet instead of the i5 or i7 versions based on reviews that I'd seen. My only concern was how long the battery would last.I wanted a tablet that would last me all day of taking notes in onenote with the surface pen (which is awesome), with the occasional breaks.In addition it had to be a windows 10 tablet, 12 inch screen or larger but 14inch was too large, and some lite gaming. Specifically (Command and Conquer Generals Zero hour) This tablet has performed admirably so far. The core m3 version was the way to go. Being fanless, means there's one less part I have to worry about wearing down.On to the Battery: If you leave power settings on high, it will not last that long. I put it in battery saving mode as soon as it comes off the charger, and it lasts quite a while. I keep the screen brightness to 50%, I also turn off the wifi when I don't have a network to connect with so that it isn't constantly searching. I've also turned off background apps that run while in sleep mode. Now when ""sleeping"" very little battery is used. For example, 6 hours of being in sleep mode off the charger and the battery is still at 100%.As far as hardware, there are several reviews already online. One thing I will touch on is the 128gb hd. ultimately that's not a ton of space, but it's not really worth it to upgrade to the i5 (256 gb) for minimal performance gains. I ended up getting a large sd card ($23) and use it to install any additional programs I may need, keeping the main hd as free as possible. As long as it's a grade 10 sd, it will be plenty fast enough.Also good to note that this is the core m3 7y30 version. the specs mention the older 6y version, but this is the new 2017 model.When it comes to Gaming, it runs CC generals perfectly. I'd recommend keeping it on the charger, but I can play off the charger for an 1hour+ and still have 43% to 50% battery remaining.This tablet is perfect with a few changes in settings!",0
I was tired of having a tablet and a laptop. This is a perfect combination of the two. Between the stylus and the full fledged Windows OS it does everything you could ask for.,1
"it’s prettily suitable for my daily work, much more portable!",1
"Love it it’s small portable and fast. With blue beam it’s great for stations, plants and refinery P&ID walk downs and start ups, or what’re you other people do 😎",1
"This has quickly become my everyday note-taking tool. It's great as a science major because most of my lectures are powerpoint/picture/diagram based. Integration with OneNote makes this machine an impeccable tool for excellent performance in these classes. If you're looking for something to invest in to improve your college experience, this is exactly you're looking for.",0
"My Surface 4 (4GB RAM) exploded due to a battery malfunction, and MS was only able to offer an identical replacement for $450. I'm grateful that I was able to get this replacement with twice the RAM, at such a good price!",0
Our surface pro runs photobooth software and prints photos immediately! Very fast computer!,1
Great for light work and meetings,0
Glad I bought this surface. It has held up and serves my needs well.,1
"I've had a MacBook pro for the past 7-8 years and the computer has ran flawlessly it's entire life. Recently with all the iOS updates and the constant program updates it would just take way too long to open programs and files so I figured it was time to upgrade. However the computer STILL WORKS so you can imagine that after 8 years my expectations for my new computer are really high.I've seen many commercials and other students using older models of the surface so I figured I would research it and maybe give it a chance. When I checked the specs and saw how powerful this new model is, and compared it to the new MacBook, the surface beat the Mac in almost every category but mainly versitality.So I ended up going with the surface and have only been amazed with it since. Granted it is brand new so it should run flawlessly, but when I loaded it with all my programs and started running multiple applications it still ran just as fast. The touch screen is extremely responsive and the overall picture quality is incredible. Even the tiny speakers can pack a decent punch and allow you to hear the subtle tone differences in music and stereo sound in movies.I am currently a student who is going into corporate sales and I highly recommend the surface to anyone who is doing something similar. The ability to use it as a laptop to develop PowerPoints and spreadsheets, then use it as a tablet to present information or write in additional notes, is beyond convenient and has changed the way I work. And when you pair it with the keyboard and pen (as well as a good case) you can practically do anything.Outside of professional life I also like to play music and also game sometimes so the processing power and video card were a concern to me. However It runs abelton smoothly and has been able to handle any steam game I have installed and run on it. And the ability to connect controllers (Xbox and midi) is flawless and the install is practically plug and play with Windows 10.Overall if you need a powerhouse of a computer but don't feel like carrying around a giant slab of a laptop this is the machine for you. I used to swear by Mac but this surface has made me come over to the dark side and I'm not leaving any time soon :)- case: Kensington black belt/ skin: skinomi carbon fiber",0
"This was an upgrade from the Surface Pro 3 and is exactly what I was hoping it would be!  Not a drastic change overall, but a solid computing machine.  Windows 10 and the Surface family of products have really made Microsoft relevant again.  I've not had any issues with blue screens or battery drain.  Touch input is great.  Would definitely buy again and recommend to others!",0
"I am generally not a heavy user of this product however, during this pandemic I have come to rely on my surface. It has never failed me, and very reliable. While I am an Apple user, the surface is definitely cheaper and more affordable",1
"I love this surface pro! It's not super big and heavy, it's just perfect size. It's also great for school or work. It came in it's original box, sealed and safely packed. I love the charger, it has a magnetic type connection, so as soon as you put it close to the surface pro, it pulls it to connect. Nice! Overall I like it and recommend it! Ps: you don't really need the keyboard.",1
I like all about my surface,1
Awesome ! I bought this for HVAC sales. Works great impressive to the customer! Paired it with a Canon portable printer. Less time to do after hours service billings and proposals= more money and more time with the family! Upgrade from that hand written invoice for more sales!,1

This tablet is everything it had been advertised to be. It is quite likely among the best ever made by Microsoft. I would definitely recommend it.,1
"What can I say more, it is working great.  I am a gamer and it is OK, good enough for me, but I don't play FPS's though.  Super multi-threaded processing, I can do several tasks (algorithms, processes, etc.) all at one time with minimal performance degradation.  Touch screen is a little sensitive to touch, sometimes touching where I don't want.  But overall, meets my needs.",0
Great product,1
"Overall a solid lightweight portable.  My wife is using it as her primary auxilliary brain during her PhD program, and she's very happy with the purchase.The only real issue is the quality control for the Windows updates in late 2018.  The hardware is great.",1
"The surface works well to sync with outlook and other microsoft products.  I switched from the Ipad because I couldn't get my ""tasks"" to sync correctly due to the PC/MAC operating system differences.  The only thing I would change is that I'd like to have a surface with a data plan, which I believe comes out in May 2018.",0
I love this thing. The perfect laptop on the go with just enough performance.,0
I really like this tablet and all the gadgets I bought with it.  It has worked really well for me.,1
"I really like the laptop. Like the weight, and the size and how everything holds together, the keyboard is great the pen attaches to it. Powerful enough for what I need it. Runs photoshop well too on the M3. Happy with it.",0
"I got the I7, 16GB, 512 BG version.Nice bright screen, and great battery life.High performing, and I'm basically using it as my laptop replacement.Work daily with it.Wish there was a USB-C port for charging.That would make it perfect. But it's Microsoft so you'll have to wait for a Pro 7 for that, maybe.",0

"The main advantages of this over a laptop are the smaller size, fully Windows compatible, and better battery life over a tablet.I recommend getting the type cover and Surface Pen to really use the Surface to its full capabilities.  This is my first Surface Pro and the pen absolutely is worth it; it's very intuitive for sketching and jotting down notes.  Even for browsing it feels more natural than a mouse or touchpad.  This thing is an absolute pleasure to use, and the fan-less i5 core is speedy and quiet.It charges relatively quickly, but a USB-C connection for faster charges would make it even better.",0
"I have been an avid mac user for my entire life.  When my most recent computer died I started to research options and began to look at the surface pro.  My number one issue with Windows back in the day was they only made software so most of the time you got an unreliable system with parts made from who know where that threw on the windows operating system.  Where the competitor developed the hard ware and software so that everything was designed to work together.Well this had all changed with Microsoft releasing the surface line of products.  Microsoft is now developing the hardware that is designed to complement its software.  Due to this huge change I spent countless hours researching and doing my homework.  And after about two months I decided to pull the trigger and come to the Microsoft world.  I am so happy that I did!!!! So far this had been on of the best systems I have owned over the years.  I love so many aspects of the surface pro and any worries I had are no more.The Pros:- Light wight- Fast Charging- Touch Screen- Full operating system- Fully runs Adobe Products with no issues (Photoshop, Premier Pro, After Effects)- High restitution display- WOW and Star craft II smooth playing and no buffers- Expendable memory slot to increase your hard drive storage ( I put in a 1 TB micro sd card )CONS:- Limited USB ports- No RJ45 port to hard line your system to the internet (WIFI ONLY)- Gets Warm (Due to no fans)- Fixed RAM so unable up upgrade or install more if you wanted to- Keyboard sold separately- Pen sold separatelyAll in all the PROS out did the cons and I am extremely happy with my purchase.  I went ahead and ordered the keyboard and pen and love them both.  To fix the USB and RJ45 issued I found a great hub that you are able to use that extents your inputs to 2 USB 3.0, RJ45 1 GPS speed, and all SD card format readers. Bellow are links to the accessories I got on Amazon to resolve the CONS of my reviewKeyboard  / cover:  https://amzn.to/37gkhsAPen: https://amzn.to/37dRV1Y1 TB SD Card: https://amzn.to/3aqx65yHUB: https://amzn.to/2G7NJoL",1
The quality of this computer is better than any Apple I've owned and it works perfectly with my preferred operating system.  The Surface Pro is everything that non-Microsoft PCs have failed to be over the years.  Windows (as might be expected) works flawlessly with this computer.  Do yourself a favor and buy this computer.,0
nice,1
very good,1
Beautiful tablet,1
Still getting use to it. Nice tablet.,1
I had a MacBook Air before this and let me tell you this is a major upgrade! Both tablet and laptop mode work amazing. the only thing is this device is not the best to put on your lap with the stand so. But besides that is very portable.,0
"Said it in the title wish I had one home, great on the go great to present on.",0
I love my new Surface pro 2017 core i5 with 8gb Ram and 256 gb SSD. Before I had Surface Pro 1 and I loved it. There are not so many differences in the sofware but The new Alcantara keyboard is lovely. The portability and the battery time are very important things and you can run a lot of videos and the surface will not get hot as the others,1
Love it better than any IPad!!!!Matter of fact I returned my iPad Pro for this,0
"Laptop, tablet, computer - all in one place. So light and so magnificient - thank you Microsoft",1
Gift,1
This is such an epic device to use. Since the day we bought it we have enjoyed it immensely.,1
Bought this primarily for digital art and its been phenomenal! The pen (not included) works great with the screen and is a must to get the best out of it. I now use it as my daily laptop and have had no issues with the performance. Highly recommend for work products and digital artist.,1
This is one of the best completely uncompromising mobile devices on the market. The quality is amazing and there is almost no compromise in performance for a very small package. It could not be better built to suit the demanding technology frequent traveller.,1
"Amazing Product. It's a bit pricey, but as they say, you get what you pay for.Build quality is Supreme. the magnesium alloy body feels great to touch and very sturdy. the kickstand also has the same quality: it can be easily rotated but also keeps its position; just on the sweet stiffness spot.As for the UI, it's very fluent. Windows is well-integrated with this pc.Speakers: wow!Fans (i7): almost silent, kicked in only once while installing an update, and never heard them since.The only drawback I find is the ports. u know, an extra USB type C (which is way better than the Mini DisplayPort) wouldn't harm anyone, but a dock should solve this issue (not necessarily Microsoft's).Other than that this is a great PC. I totally Recommend.",1
Works very well. Pretty sure it was brand new. The price was fantastic. I bought this as an intro to digital art. Very pleased! (heads up; good luck changing the lock screen picture),1
Amazing,1
But I love it. When I dropped two grand on this thing I was iffy about whether or not I actually needed it that bad but it works so amazingly as a replacement for a laptop that you can use as a tablet. Its all I use apart from my desktop computer now. Great product.,0
Love it! It's powerful enough to handle programs I use to have to run on a desk top and super portable. I'd recommend a surface to anyone.,1
Love this product! Everything I need in a tablet/ laptop,1
"Love this Surface Pro. Bought it for artwork, but I use it for almost everything. Boots quickly, decent battery life, impressive when paired with the surface pen.Gets warm when playing video games (Starcraft II and Diablo III), but it runs them well! Did not expect to use it for gaming, but I am.Good precision with the surface pen. Really love drawing on it.Highly recommend the i7 18gb.",1
"I like the Surface Pro a lot more than I thought I would.  I had random Hibernation problems the first few weeks, but Microsoft has updated and I do not have the issue any more.  Great for travel.",0

"I'm a real estate agent and use this every single day. I use it in my office when I don't want to wait for the computer to fire up or when I'm out of the office it allows me to be massively productive. After popping in a T-Mobile SIM card, I have a tablet sized computer that allows me to work from anywhere without needing wi-fi. My Surface is so awesome I haven't taken my laptop with me since I purchased 7 months ago; even when I went out of town. Where I go, my Surface goes.The three biggest ways this has helped me in my business:1) When I am out with a client in random houses I can pull up info as easy and quickly as if I were in my office.2) I have greatly reduced the amount of paper and ink I use by inserting pdf docs into OneNote and using my Surface pen to take notes, highlight, etc. Bonus: It syncs with the computer in my office.3) Being a single Dad of two, I spend a lot of time sitting in the car waiting. I get a ton of stuff done in my car while waiting for carpool to start or practices to finish, etc.I tell people all of the time... it is the best thing I've ever spent money on.",1
"Love this device. I am in a #apple family. However, this has all the capabilities and ease of use I wish my iPad had. I can use it like a fully functioning regular computer or an easy to handle tablet for reading and writing. I used it to record class lectures and take notes in one note. I've used it to run live webinars and turn the recordings into youtube videos.It was a bit of a learning curve to copy, paste and arrange the screen while in certain settings but once I got the hang of it it became second nature.Only have two complaints which I'm sure I will be able to remedy. The first is not having a solid feature like apple to edit video. I recall editing videos just fine on Windows devices previously but can not figure it out for the life of me on this device. I assume there is an additional bit of software I may need to purchase.The second complaint is it doesn't really work well with a lap desk due to the need for the kickstand to prop it up. If I could use the keyboard without it being attached I could use a lap desk that is designed to hold a tablet, however, I don't believe that is a feature at this time.",1
Excellent,1

"Amazing product. I can’t speak highly enough about it. The software and hardware work really well together. Microsoft did a really good job with the touchscreen and with the surface pen, drawling on this thing works really well. This is well worth the price.",1
"I bought this to replace my Surface Pro 4, which had a screen flickering issue that developed after about 1 year of use. This is a well known issue and many angry customers have voiced their experiences online (search ""Flickergate""). So, after about 2 months of light use of my new Surface Pro, the same problem is happening again. The screen flickering issue has not been fixed in the new model.",0
"Had a horrible experience with a gen 6 and went back to the gen 5 instead. I now own 4 of these for the wife and kids. Super fast, and runs anything we throw at it",1
"Excellent product, was received as described, was delivered at the correct time.",0
"Great shipping, after going through other laptops all of them were terrible. I finally gave in and bought the surface pro 5, which I used at my last job and loved. It is ABSOLUTELY worth it, pair it with the amazon insurance and bam. It's cheaper than microsoft and the warranty is better for a cheaper price!!!",0
"I upgraded from Surface Pro 4 i5..... Honestly, my old one was just fine and did absolutely anything and everything that I needed.  I purchased the new i7 version of the Surface Pro 5 because I wanted to play games faster.  I couldn't imagine my life without a surface pro",1
Love the face recognition to start working on your Pro. Excellent screen. It's fast and works very well.,1

awesome machine!,1
Excellent equipment. I recommend. Fast and easy to use.,1
Actually I like surface more than other OS tablets I prefer windows tablets.,1
"It has all the power of a big bulky laptop with the size and weight of a tablet. The keyboard comes in handy when you need to hold a button and drag an object or when you want to sit at a table and type out reviews. I got the pen that goes with it and it works great! You can draw free hand, take hand written notes or draw in AutoCAD, Visio or PowerPoint easier than with a mouse.I’d say size weight and battery life make this the best computer I’ve ever owned.",1
Powerful... I ordered to replace my laptop that I had set up with a docking station.  I did the same for this using my existing keyboard and mouse with the docking station setup.  I also bough the cover/keyboard which in retrospect was a waste.,0
Perfect for my college bound son.,1
"Had never used one like this before.  Have large screen laptop and desktops but this is a new pleasant experience for me.  One thing, protective cover is necessity for screen.",1
"So far I love my new computer. I probably should have gotten one with more memory, but the cost was not in my budget. I added an external hard drive to expand the capability without spending too much.  I think this is going to work out fantastically. The size and light weight of the Surface Pro make it great for taking along on trips.",0
Love this thing,1
It's a computer it's a tablet it is fantastic. If your thinking about getting an iPad your better off getting this.,0
"My first one died in two weeks, the replacement has been running well for a year. Love it!Downsides -- replacement charger cord is ridiculously expensive, $70+. Also be very careful which case you buy if you have the fastest processor, some cases labeled as OK for this model will block the vents for the cooling fan resulting in overheating. Slower processor models don't have a cooling fan.",0
"As usual, the Windows experience is quirky. If you're coming from Apple, you'll notice it.I like the expanded functionality of the Pro tablet. I'm using the Surface Pro cover, and run AutoCAD LT 2018 with a 27"" 4k monitor off this little wonder and am quite pleased with the performance.Windows tends to lose peripherals, and does so but not too bad. So I fault the OS for this and not the tablet.Also, at the price, this is a very spendy tablet and is much more of a full featured PC (sans drives and slots). Runs cool. Has great battery life. Highest resolution per inch of any tablet I've used so far.",0

"--UPDATE--Disabling the auto screen brightness feature seems to correct the below issue.The device will reset at random times. It doesn’t seem to matter what I’m doing. After a review on reddit , I found many early adopters are experiencing the same issue. See thread: “Suspend/Poweroff at Random Surface Pro 2017 i5”.--Original Review--Received my Surface Pro yesterday and used it all evening. Here are my initial thoughts, hope they help.My device Intel Core i7, 8GB RAM, 256GB, coming from an Ipad Pro.Pros:1. It’s a full PC. If it works on PC, It works on this.2. Ease of use. I love how it easy it is to load UHD video files. Playback is flawless. Never did get this working on Ipad.3. Fast and responsive.4. Build quality is premium. Love the new rounded edges.5. Near silent. It has a fan, but it’s not loud enough to remember it’s even there. I think the i5 doesn’t even have one.6. Battery life is really good. Again I haven’t done any official tests, but it lasted all evening on the “out of the box” charge.7. Screen resolution is crisp and bright. Looks great playing hi res videos.8. Expandable storage with a micro SD card. This is a no brainer. Get a clue Apple.9. USB port. Again, Apple WTF?Cons:1. I wish the bezel was a little thinner. It would be nice to have more screen real-estate.2. A little smaller than ipad pro.3. It gets a little warm. Not sure about thermal throttling. I haven’t tested.  But it does get a bit warm holding in your hands after a while.4. While I was browsing the web, it lockup and screen went black, after a few seconds it auto reset. This happened just once. Didn’t happen again all night.Conclusion:I really love it. This is the device the Ipad Pro should have been. This is a truly awesome laptop replacement and I enjoy using it. The most versatile portal tablet on the market.",1
Excellent product but don’t order it here! Go to a store and buy it in person so you can get the product you want!,1
"When I tried starting my Surface Pro for the first time the OOBE software (""Out Of Box Experience"" software) persistently failed with an OOBEIDPS message. (A Google search will tell you more). I tried all online suggestions I could find, but nothing worked. So I sent the Surface back for exchange.Sadly, the replacement suffered the same problem! (What the hell!???)So this time I called Microsoft Software Support. Eventually, I reached someone on their ""Surface Support Team"", and he showed me how to fix it.  - The secret sauce is to force a System Restart Update...  - You start the process by forcing a power reset.  - You start that by holding down the power on/off button for ""20 seconds"".I Thought I knew all about this, but what I did not know is that there are TWO levels of forced power-reset.What most people, including myself, already know about is after a few seconds of holding down the button, you get a message that says something line ""Slide down to power down the PC"". DON'T DO THAT.Instead, just keep holding down the power button, and after many more seconds, the machine will simply reboot...  - The screen goes black,  - Then the simplified windows logon (four white squares) appears.Now, finally, you can let go of the power button.From this point, just follow the prompts. The system will update itself, and eventually the OOBE will run successfully.  ---I believe the sellers were not aware of this problem,so I hope they read this so that they can take corrective actionbefore having to deal with too many more returns.",1
"THe model I bought only has 128 GB SSD. That is it's one shortcoming. If I'd gone with the larger SSD, the shortcoming would have been price, so there you are. This tablet computer really does productivity software well. It isn't a gaming machine, but I didn't buy it for that. I'm using it with a digit piano and for that it is perfect.PROS:- Built amazingly well, or feels like it.- Core i5 processor is a snappy performer- the design manages the heat of the Core i5 CPU well- it Just worksCONS:- a little pricey even for the smallest SSD version- Not bundled with keyboard (bundle was sold out)- Not bundled with the pen",1
It is excellent.  Jumps from app to app quick and smoothly.  Touch screen is responsive.  Bluetooth has worked flawlessly.  Screen has a great picture.,0
"Solid 4/5 stars.Pros:-Great screen: the touchscreen is responsive and the ppi density is 267, which is far better than most regular laptops, let alone touchscreen ones.-Good battery life: After over 2 years, the Surface Pro still works really well. I've used it heavily for online college classes, internet browsing, and video playback, and the battery still lasts about 8 hours depending on what it's being used for.-Good processing speed: I regularly have well over 50 tabs open at a time for research paper sources, news articles I want to read later, etc., and I've only ever had one instance where the computer or browser froze. [That said, it's not the faster laptop either, and The Sims 4 (and presumably similar games) has to be set at the lowest settings in order to run without glitching, or overheating the laptop. Small or older games like Among Us and Insaniquarium run with no issues.]-Power cord: The cord is magnetic, so it won't damage the laptop or itself if it gets pulled out unexpectedly, and it won't pull the laptop off of a table if someone trips on it.-Surface pen: the surface pen makes it very easy to use drawing programs. Have not had any issues with the pen at all.-Keyboard: the keyboard is responsive and the fabric coating has lasted far better than I thought it would. I have the silver/gray color and you'd barely know it's not brand new.Cons:-Headphone jack: the headphone jack has always been a bit buggy (the audio doesn't always switch to headphones when they are inserted), and as of last Friday, after 2 years and 3 months, the headphone jack no longer works at all, no matter what set of headphones is used with it.-Power cord: Very occasionally the laptop won't register that it's plugged in, and it has to be restarted to get it to charge.-No disk drive and no expandable storage.Overall this laptop is great as a college laptop, as a drawing tablet, or for very light games. I would not recommend this to anyone who wants to run more demanding games, or to anyone who wanted to do heavy video editing.",0
Surfaces are working out perfect for what we needed them for!,1
"I have been an avid mac user for my entire life.  When my most recent computer died I started to research options and began to look at the surface pro.  My number one issue with Windows back in the day was they only made software so most of the time you got an unreliable system with parts made from who know where that threw on the windows operating system.  Where the competitor developed the hard ware and software so that everything was designed to work together.Well this had all changed with Microsoft releasing the surface line of products.  Microsoft is now developing the hardware that is designed to complement its software.  Due to this huge change I spent countless hours researching and doing my homework.  And after about two months I decided to pull the trigger and come to the Microsoft world.  I am so happy that I did!!!! So far this had been on of the best systems I have owned over the years.  I love so many aspects of the surface pro and any worries I had are no more.The Pros:- Light wight- Fast Charging- Touch Screen- Full operating system- Fully runs Adobe Products with no issues (Photoshop, Premier Pro, After Effects)- High restitution display- WOW and Star craft II smooth playing and no buffers- Expendable memory slot to increase your hard drive storage ( I put in a 1 TB micro sd card )CONS:- Limited USB ports- No RJ45 port to hard line your system to the internet (WIFI ONLY)- Gets Warm (Due to no fans)- Fixed RAM so unable up upgrade or install more if you wanted to- Keyboard sold separately- Pen sold separatelyAll in all the PROS out did the cons and I am extremely happy with my purchase.  I went ahead and ordered the keyboard and pen and love them both.  To fix the USB and RJ45 issued I found a great hub that you are able to use that extents your inputs to 2 USB 3.0, RJ45 1 GPS speed, and all SD card format readers. Bellow are links to the accessories I got on Amazon to resolve the CONS of my reviewKeyboard  / cover:  https://amzn.to/37gkhsAPen: https://amzn.to/37dRV1Y1 TB SD Card: https://amzn.to/3aqx65yHUB: https://amzn.to/2G7NJoL",0
"I bought this to replace my Surface Pro 4, which had a screen flickering issue that developed after about 1 year of use. This is a well known issue and many angry customers have voiced their experiences online (search ""Flickergate""). So, after about 2 months of light use of my new Surface Pro, the same problem is happening again. The screen flickering issue has not been fixed in the new model.",1
"beauty, powerfull",1
"I needed a portable device to work while I'm on the road, and this is perfect! It is extremely light-weight. The keyboard is a good size, even for fat fingers like me.",1
Excellent product.  Very fast and simple to use for any PC user looking to switch to a tablet.,1
"Overall a solid lightweight portable.  My wife is using it as her primary auxilliary brain during her PhD program, and she's very happy with the purchase.The only real issue is the quality control for the Windows updates in late 2018.  The hardware is great.",0
"This surface pro is great.  I use it all the time.  What I really like is the tablet features and yet I can still run normal programs on it.  In the last few years I’ve had an ipad, a Samsung tablet, and I have to say this surface pro is better than them hands down.With my other tablets all I could is apps and hope that someone made a program similar to one on my pc that I could use.  All the apps never matched up to the actual program that would run on a pc.  This is the main reason I purchased this over getting another tablet.  Sure tablets are great and easy to use but they lack the power and operating systems that make them actual functioning computers.If you’re looking for something to go beyond the basic tablet I would suggest getting the surface.  The interface is windows which most people know.  The stylus and screen work great together and the batter life is good.  The only down side I would have to say about it has to do with windows 10.  I wish it had a better tablet interface but the added ability of switching to basic computer mode more than off sets this draw back.  Over all I would say it’s been a great purchase",0
I love my new Surface Pro 7!,1
THIS PRODUCT IS EXACTLY WHAT WAS NEEDED FOR OUR GOVERNMENT OFFICE.  THE CAPABILITIES FAR EXCEED THE DESKTOP COMPUTER IT REPLACES.,1
"I love this laptop! I did a lot of research before purchasing since I don’t know a lot about computer specs. I wasn’t sure what storage or speed would be appropriate but not overboard for my general purposes. It’s lightweight and the easiest setup possible. The facial recognition feature is great although it didn’t recognize me after I took my makeup off and put my hair up so we had to do another visual. Now it recognizes me every time! It’s fast and incredibly easy to use. I’m not a gamer but for general internet usage, movies, writing the storage capacity and speed are great. I’m not a huge fan of the windows tiles home screen but that isn’t really the laptops fault. Overall it’s definitely worth it and I’ve already recommended it to a few friends.",1
"Fast, easy to use. Im a full apple user but needed a good portable pc for work since i need some software that only runs on windows. I was considering a macbook with parallels, but the cost, plus software plus the windows license made me look for other options. This is a beautiful machine, fast and simple. No extra software to slow it down, so you get windows at its best. Highly recommend it. Im still an apple user. But credit is given were credit is due.",1
"Love the portability of the tablet. Love the power of the tablet. For reference I have a dell laptop that's only a year old, and this surface has the same power the laptop has. I can do everything I need from the surface.Note that I did not buy the docking station because I intended this to be a ""travel laptop"" to keep me from having to lug my laptop home nightly. Having said that, my only knock against it is the screen size. I could really use another few inches on the screen. Having said that, I could buy the docking station and solve the issue.Love the tablet. Expensive but for someone who travels out of town every few weeks and wants something more than a phone to check emails at night, it's worth it.",1
Fast shipment and a flawless screen.,1
I really like this PC. I use it for work and so far it has great reliability.,1
"I'm a real estate agent and use this every single day. I use it in my office when I don't want to wait for the computer to fire up or when I'm out of the office it allows me to be massively productive. After popping in a T-Mobile SIM card, I have a tablet sized computer that allows me to work from anywhere without needing wi-fi. My Surface is so awesome I haven't taken my laptop with me since I purchased 7 months ago; even when I went out of town. Where I go, my Surface goes.The three biggest ways this has helped me in my business:1) When I am out with a client in random houses I can pull up info as easy and quickly as if I were in my office.2) I have greatly reduced the amount of paper and ink I use by inserting pdf docs into OneNote and using my Surface pen to take notes, highlight, etc. Bonus: It syncs with the computer in my office.3) Being a single Dad of two, I spend a lot of time sitting in the car waiting. I get a ton of stuff done in my car while waiting for carpool to start or practices to finish, etc.I tell people all of the time... it is the best thing I've ever spent money on.",0
This is one of my favorite computers I have ever owned. Touchscreen is beautiful. Size and weight are perfect for traveling and the pen opens up a whole new world for creative work. Powerful enough to run all my Adobe software. I might never buy a laptop again.,1
"Love it, came by mid-day, no damage, looks great!",1
BEST thing since sliced bread - my husband's idea and it is wonderful!  Cannot believe how fast and easy this is to use!,1
"This laptop has served me well for the last three years. I bought it as a gift for myself during 2017 holidays and Im writing this review from that same laptop.Believe it or not all my other devices are made by Apple but there is something about this laptop that is making me NOT give up. I use this laptop A LOT and to my surprise the battery is still performing well. I charge it for around 40-50 mins in the morning and it lasts till bedtime.I guess Windows updates have made this laptop more usable. For eg., in one of the previous Windows 10 versions, using YouTube in laptop mode was a nightmare. In the latest version, in laptop mode, YouTube acts just like it would on your phone. Windows updates have been seamless too.This is also my travel companion. With Netflix, you can download movies to watch on flights. With mini-SD card reader you can transfer photos (I also use GoPro then I can transfer them to my laptop with mini-SD card).This is by far the best laptop money can buy. I cannot be more happier.",1

Bought 4 months ago and now there are hard ware issues with bluetooth.  I updated all the drivers and software and the Bluetooth feature wil cut in and out.  Tried to return to vendor and my window has closed.  Tried to open a warranty claim w microsof and it says my warranty ended in 8/2020. I did not buy a refurbed device..... I just bought in march form this vendor and now I am stuck with an expensive piece of crap.  WILL NOT buy from this vendor again.,1

this is the perfect labtop for on the go & just about anything. i use it for daily things nothing major like gaming ur works great!,0
"I regret buying a model that doesn't include a type C port, but other than that, this baby works like a dream. I use it as an ultraportable between school and work. I also use the cobalt surface pen to write on the screen while I tutor students over the internet. The battery usually lasts me a week if I use it lightly and shut it down between uses. The hardware isn't for gamers, but it runs Cuphead perfectly.",0

"Love this device. I am in a #apple family. However, this has all the capabilities and ease of use I wish my iPad had. I can use it like a fully functioning regular computer or an easy to handle tablet for reading and writing. I used it to record class lectures and take notes in one note. I've used it to run live webinars and turn the recordings into youtube videos.It was a bit of a learning curve to copy, paste and arrange the screen while in certain settings but once I got the hang of it it became second nature.Only have two complaints which I'm sure I will be able to remedy. The first is not having a solid feature like apple to edit video. I recall editing videos just fine on Windows devices previously but can not figure it out for the life of me on this device. I assume there is an additional bit of software I may need to purchase.The second complaint is it doesn't really work well with a lap desk due to the need for the kickstand to prop it up. If I could use the keyboard without it being attached I could use a lap desk that is designed to hold a tablet, however, I don't believe that is a feature at this time.",0
"This is an awesome computer. Works well as a pad, the screen is responsive to the touch or a pen. I added the hub for the office, use two screens, a mouse, and keyboard, and it's perfect. Great.",0
"I got the i7 2017 surface 16Gb to replace my ageing Alienware which was like a brick to play blizzard games at LAN parties. I can honestly say I've never been more satisfied with a portable computer purchase. So far we've been doing Starcraft remastered, Starcraft 2, overwatch, and Heros of the storm and the only occasional issue I've seen is when I start the games the active mouse region is inappropriately mapped to the pixel resolution and not to the scaled game resolution as the surface has a high resolution display and will by default scale each app so they appear properly. I have discovered that using Alt tab to switch to the desktop and back quickly fixes this issue. The games seem to detect that I am not using a discrete graphics card and automatically configure themselves for the lowest settings which do no bother me at all. A feature that I like is the facial recognition since it takes no effort to login. This is a huge convenience because I only use this system for LAN parties and web browsing and really don't want to spend a lot of time typing in passwords over and over again. Really makes this feel like a futuristic biometric signature. I hope Microsoft continues making incredible stuff like this.I got this system with its keyboard and arc mouse and pen and they work great.",1
Love it,1
"Great for work. I bought this specifically to support my automation design side gig. It really helps me take notes at customers facilities and record accurate measurements to then turn into 3D models. Now with that being said, it cant support the high end modeling packages. But I wouldnt expect it to. Its a great field tool and will get extensive use. I use it frequently at home to replace my laptop as well. Light games (havent tried more than civ 5), word processing, email, notes, drawing for fun, and that kind of thing.",0
Love the Surface Pro and can hardly wait to take it on speaking trips!,0
"Over the years I have bought many ultra books, tablets, laptops etc. and always had an element of disappointment.  This is the first tablet/ laptop I have bought that has exceeded my expectations.  When detached from the keyboard it really is a fine tablet and when attached to the keyboard is a good laptop for travel or occasional use in the home.  I would not go as far as saying that it replaces my desktop (2 Hi Res screens etc.) but it comes closer than anything I have had before.  Very fast, light and easy to transport with good battery life.",0

I'm in love. Excited to continue exploring my new Microsoft Surface Pro!,0
Fantastic device,1
Unlike most products is worth the money and lives up to the hype.,0
"This is my first Surface tablet. I bought the 5th generation, I don't know if it's officially called a Surface Pro 5, but that's what I'll call it.I compared against the brand new 6th gen, and didn't see enough of a significant difference to warrant the higher price.There were some MAJOR shipping problems with this, that were mostly Amazon's fault. Apparently they felt mine was a suspicious purchase, even though I've spent tens of thousands of dollars at Amazon. This was probably my most expensive single purchase, so while their suspicion might have been justified, they seemed to simply sit on it, instead of attempting to contact me to determine if I really made this purchase. The seller told me they couldn't ship until Amazon gave the ok. I contacted Amazon several times, getting different excuses every time. Once they told me it was a stock issue. That was a lie. Then they told me it was stuck in a certain status, that was apparently a lie. Then they told me it was a suspicious purchase, maybe because I applied for the Amazon credit card to pay for it. But, if that going to be the case every time someone applies for the card when they make a big purchase, they're going to have a LOT of pissed off people, me included.Eventually someone at Amazon assured me I would have the item on a certain day, it showed up 2 days after that date. So for a Prime item that was in stock, I received it 5 days later than it should have been. The rating on this review is not based on this experience, just letting people know.Anyway. The Surface Pro 5 is very fast, I bought the top of the line (Core i7, 16gb RAM, 1tb SSD). The display is excellent, seems clearer than my HP 25"" monitors on my desktop PCs.I bought a third part type cover, from Fintie. I had experience with their bluetooth keyboards I've used with my Android tablet, so I gave it a try, since it was half the price of the MS type cover.I have to get used to a non-Android tablet. Only one home screen, is the main thing. I have learned to use the surface mainly in tablet mode, just easier with the touch screen.The touch screen can be frustrating in some ways. Mainly when trying to grab a corner or edge of a window to resize. Or when trying to slide a video progress bar or sound level slider. For example: I watch games on NFL Gamepass, and it seems impossible using your finger to grab and slide the video position slider. I can do it with a mouse, but not with my finger. I've tried tap and slide, tap-hold and slide. But it just doesn't work. I've also found accuracy isn't great with my finger either. Trying to hit a relatively small play/pause button on the video takes a few tries much of the time. Just can't seem to hit the sweet spot. That's the main reason I've removed one star.I did purchase a stylus, but haven't really explored the Ink options, just doodled on the screen a few times. An artist I am not.I do recommend the Surface. I can't compare it to an iPad, since I don't use Apple products if I can help it.",1
"Exellent unit. So far no issuee had it for couple of week bought it on amazon. Good delivery service no issues. Updated the system without any problems. boots up fine. No issues there. Granted you can get a touch screen laptop that size with similar features for a lesser price but microsoft surface does have its advantages. Such as battery life, portablity, easy conversion from a laptop to tablet, great for photo shop if your into that. Also stop complaining about stupid stuff like having propiorty parts and cables and stuff. If you get hardware and software issues should have bought the extended warrenty. Every one knows that manufacture warrenty is useless. every one knows microsoft outsources their techsupport. That is nothing new and stop comparing with apple. They are 2 different units. And fyi if your willing to drop a 2000 on a mac good luck with prepiorty parts and software compatiblity issues. 70% of the world and businesses use microsoft than apple due to compatility. They are more expensive than other manufacture companies. I bet you my desktop granted it is not portable can out perform any mac out there and i built mine from ground up for 1500.",0
Best tablet pc I've ever owned.,1
"What can I say more, it is working great.  I am a gamer and it is OK, good enough for me, but I don't play FPS's though.  Super multi-threaded processing, I can do several tasks (algorithms, processes, etc.) all at one time with minimal performance degradation.  Touch screen is a little sensitive to touch, sometimes touching where I don't want.  But overall, meets my needs.",1
"Excelente, fue mi primera compra y me siento muy satisfecho, el equipo fue entregada a tiempo y en las mejores condiciones",1
Fast shipment and a flawless screen.,0
I love this laptop/tablet combo. It is very responsive to touch. the keyboard is great. I love using the pen makes taking notes easy during lectures I open the power point and draw straight on them or write on them.  I recommend getting a tempered glass screen protector and a sturdy case for it. I really do like that you can add a memory card to it. Battery lasts hours and hours before needing to be charge.,1
Got exactly what I ordered plus some and all in better condition than I was expecting at that! Good deal!!,1
"I'm a college engineering student and very pleased with my purchase.  It was beautifully designed and I don't regret spending a little more than usual for this.My main concern in my laptop search was that my old laptop was just too heavy.  I wanted something lightweight to do work on wherever I stopped on campus.  I am not a fan of plain old tablets for that use so this definitely did the trick. It's the perfect combination between laptop and tablet.I really love being able to comfortably type, or quickly detach the keyboard and have a lightweight tablet to draw my notes on using the Surface pen. I am satisfied with the picture and sound quality and battery life.The only downside I would say is the lack of ports on the Surface. You get a charging port, only one USB port, and a mini-display port.  This has not been a problem for me with how I use it but is something to consider.  You can buy a mini-display to HDMI convert for only $6 so I have no issues with the ports so far.",1

"Great machine - if you're not scammed. I purchased a Surface Pro with the i5 Processor from the seller 'Electronics, Toys, and Games.'It came in a shrink-wrapped box that looked legitimate - the box had a serial number, as well as the model (i5). I happened to be running some diagnostics and noticed the processor is not an i5, but an m3 - almost $300 less in value. I would not have noticed otherwise. Furthermore, the serial number did not match the box - absolutely fraudulent. PLEASE be sure to check your specs and serial number before you do anything, and DO NOT buy from 'Electronic, Toys, and Games'!",0
I really like this tablet and all the gadgets I bought with it.  It has worked really well for me.,0
Love it better than any IPad!!!!Matter of fact I returned my iPad Pro for this,1
Great purchase!,1
"This is my third PRO.  Hello works great with this version, even in a darken room.  Very responsive.  I use for Lightroom CC and Photoshop CC  and it works great.  Able to down load RAW files very fast and do Post processing when in the field.  I am very impressed with the build quality of the tablet.  Has a USB port that will work with a hub.  Also can connect to a TV through a cable adapter and HDMI to watch shows on the go.",0
"After years with an ipad and Samsung Note, this machine rocks.  I love this thing.  It is literally a pc in a tablet.  And MS store people and policy beats apple like a rented mule.  I loaded it up with office and all the apps I need, so it really is a copy of my desktop.",1

"It has all the power of a big bulky laptop with the size and weight of a tablet. The keyboard comes in handy when you need to hold a button and drag an object or when you want to sit at a table and type out reviews. I got the pen that goes with it and it works great! You can draw free hand, take hand written notes or draw in AutoCAD, Visio or PowerPoint easier than with a mouse.I’d say size weight and battery life make this the best computer I’ve ever owned.",0
I was unsure about spending this much on the Surface but did it anyways.  I could not be more happy with my purchase.  I have docking stations at my home and office so I can run two extra screens at a time. The quality and speed are great. No lag between screens. I run two 27inch screens with high quality. Best purchase ever. Iv had this product for two years and have had no problems. I save everything to the cloud so my computer dont get full of junk.  Seriously I'm not sure if I said it or not but I'm extremely happy with my purchase,0
Wonderful machine,1
works exactly as I expected. No complaints at all. I'm glad I went for this .,1
"The surface works well to sync with outlook and other microsoft products.  I switched from the Ipad because I couldn't get my ""tasks"" to sync correctly due to the PC/MAC operating system differences.  The only thing I would change is that I'd like to have a surface with a data plan, which I believe comes out in May 2018.",1
"The device itself is excellent. It is, however, important to review some of the minutiae about it.You do require to purchase several extra pieces of gear to maximize its use. Since it only has one USB port you may find yourself needing to buy thee accompanying mouse to save the slot for the use of flash drives and such since it doesnt require the port's use. It also doesn't come with the stylus pen, a feature included in the previous model (Pro 4) which means a larger investment. The micro SD port behind the stand came as a big surprise to me and its a very welcome addition.Also if you want more ports you could buy the surface dock which uses the charger port for data transfer and even networking capabilities. Unfortunately it is also extremely dense if relatively small and you won't have a light, fun little kit anymore.However, all this aside you do have the options as to what you wish to carry given the use you intend to give it in any situation. Battery life is more than I expected and processing power makes it run smoothly. I really enjoy it!",1
I receive my Surface Pro 5 very good I want to congrats Microsoft for produce Sachin nice device,1
Love it so far.,1
The quality of this computer is better than any Apple I've owned and it works perfectly with my preferred operating system.  The Surface Pro is everything that non-Microsoft PCs have failed to be over the years.  Windows (as might be expected) works flawlessly with this computer.  Do yourself a favor and buy this computer.,1
"Love, love, love this Surface Pro! It's light years better than the Surface Pro 3 I had a few years ago. I use it all the time!",0
"I Love that it came in the original box, it was all brand new & unused.",1
"I purchased this tablet instead of the i5 or i7 versions based on reviews that I'd seen. My only concern was how long the battery would last.I wanted a tablet that would last me all day of taking notes in onenote with the surface pen (which is awesome), with the occasional breaks.In addition it had to be a windows 10 tablet, 12 inch screen or larger but 14inch was too large, and some lite gaming. Specifically (Command and Conquer Generals Zero hour) This tablet has performed admirably so far. The core m3 version was the way to go. Being fanless, means there's one less part I have to worry about wearing down.On to the Battery: If you leave power settings on high, it will not last that long. I put it in battery saving mode as soon as it comes off the charger, and it lasts quite a while. I keep the screen brightness to 50%, I also turn off the wifi when I don't have a network to connect with so that it isn't constantly searching. I've also turned off background apps that run while in sleep mode. Now when ""sleeping"" very little battery is used. For example, 6 hours of being in sleep mode off the charger and the battery is still at 100%.As far as hardware, there are several reviews already online. One thing I will touch on is the 128gb hd. ultimately that's not a ton of space, but it's not really worth it to upgrade to the i5 (256 gb) for minimal performance gains. I ended up getting a large sd card ($23) and use it to install any additional programs I may need, keeping the main hd as free as possible. As long as it's a grade 10 sd, it will be plenty fast enough.Also good to note that this is the core m3 7y30 version. the specs mention the older 6y version, but this is the new 2017 model.When it comes to Gaming, it runs CC generals perfectly. I'd recommend keeping it on the charger, but I can play off the charger for an 1hour+ and still have 43% to 50% battery remaining.This tablet is perfect with a few changes in settings!",1
Bought this item slightly used and I can barely tell if it was used all. Excellent condition and excellent performance for money thus far. Will purchase again,1
No problems so far!,1
Great tool for me in my current roll where I need a very portable smaller computer that can easily handle email and spreadsheets.,1
"The description states a 3.5 GHz processor but it is only 2.7 GHz. Either way, it serves its purpose. It is fast, reliable and far more useful than a desktop for what I need.",0
This PC works exactly as I expected. No complaints at all. I'm glad I went for this model.,0
BEST thing since sliced bread - my husband's idea and it is wonderful!  Cannot believe how fast and easy this is to use!,0
"Great for my travels, converts between a tablet or notebook depending on my needs or works space. Battery life has been really good so far.",0
These i5 Surfaces are amazing for the price. Instead of having to drop nearly 3k on a new top end surface.  The only cons I have with this device is the new dock vs the old traditional dock.,1
Excellent product but don’t order it here! Go to a store and buy it in person so you can get the product you want!,0
"I absolutely love this computer. I bought it prior to my first semester in law school. I waited until after first semester to write a review to see how it held up to daily use. It is still going strong. It also works well with the glitchy ExamSoft software we are required to use for exams.The battery life is fantastic. Although I brought my charger to class every day, I only had to charge the computer when I got home at night.",1
"I purchased this for general use and work.  The core m surface is fast enough and opens documents. and other programs really quick.  Everything is built into the tablet, so don't expect to be able to swap the ssd out easily.  It is possible to swap out the sad but would void the warranty.  The touch screen responds perfect and have yet to have issues with the surface keyboard/cover attachment I bought separately. I reviewed this product ocer the galaxy tab s3 and apple iPad.  I solely bought this because of the speed and other devices we have in the home for integration purposes.  If I was an apple enthusiasts, I would have bought the ipad.  The reason I did not choose the galaxy tab s3 was due to the clunky keyboard/cover and applications available on it.",1
nice,1
"Great machine - if you're not scammed. I purchased a Surface Pro with the i5 Processor from the seller 'Electronics, Toys, and Games.'It came in a shrink-wrapped box that looked legitimate - the box had a serial number, as well as the model (i5). I happened to be running some diagnostics and noticed the processor is not an i5, but an m3 - almost $300 less in value. I would not have noticed otherwise. Furthermore, the serial number did not match the box - absolutely fraudulent. PLEASE be sure to check your specs and serial number before you do anything, and DO NOT buy from 'Electronic, Toys, and Games'!",1
as expected.  I mainly use this as a reader.  I considered epaper devices but the ability to use Adobe Acrobat (and it's search functions) and external USB drives made the final choice for me.,1
I like it!,1
Excellent design and size I love it,1
"Exellent unit. So far no issuee had it for couple of week bought it on amazon. Good delivery service no issues. Updated the system without any problems. boots up fine. No issues there. Granted you can get a touch screen laptop that size with similar features for a lesser price but microsoft surface does have its advantages. Such as battery life, portablity, easy conversion from a laptop to tablet, great for photo shop if your into that. Also stop complaining about stupid stuff like having propiorty parts and cables and stuff. If you get hardware and software issues should have bought the extended warrenty. Every one knows that manufacture warrenty is useless. every one knows microsoft outsources their techsupport. That is nothing new and stop comparing with apple. They are 2 different units. And fyi if your willing to drop a 2000 on a mac good luck with prepiorty parts and software compatiblity issues. 70% of the world and businesses use microsoft than apple due to compatility. They are more expensive than other manufacture companies. I bet you my desktop granted it is not portable can out perform any mac out there and i built mine from ground up for 1500.",1
I love this laptop/tablet combo. It is very responsive to touch. the keyboard is great. I love using the pen makes taking notes easy during lectures I open the power point and draw straight on them or write on them.  I recommend getting a tempered glass screen protector and a sturdy case for it. I really do like that you can add a memory card to it. Battery lasts hours and hours before needing to be charge.,0
my 4GB basic model was lagging with multiple windows and spreadsheet open.  This one has solved all my problems.  the speed difference is life changing,0
"este surface es mejor que una surface pro 4, me agrada el procesador el 4 tenia problemas de pantalla. es mejor la pro 5 y es de buena calidad muy buena",1
"I first have to say that I did not purchase my Surface Pro through Amazon. However, Amazon is pretty much the most popular place to read reviews before purchasing items. So I'm posting my review here, in hopes it helps others make their decision.First the obvious. The device looks and feels like a premium item. The vent slots around the top edge are even less visible than on the previous model (Surface pro 4). Even though the edges are slightly rounder on the new version, I would not have noticed unless told about it.My core i5 model is fan-less, meaning COMPLETELY silent. You will not hear a peep out of this device. Definitely an improvement from the previous generation.I'm pleasantly surprised at how cool to the touch the device stays, even after hours of uninterrupted use. Definitely on par, or better than my ipad slim. I bought mine during my lunch hour from work. I came back to the office, plugged it in and ran through initial set up.The device was at about 40% charge when I pulled it out of the box. I then charged it to 100%, and proceeded to time the beginning, and end time for every use session. This way I could accurately measure the real world battery life with normal use.I used it for a total of 5 sessions in the first 24 hours, and got 6 1/2 hours of actual use time. In that time, I read and replied to e-mails, downloaded and set up all office 365 applications, played around in Onenote, then sketched with the pen for about an hour, watched a couple of hours of youtube videos, imported and tweaked some spreadsheets in Excel, used the pen to work out lots of math problems and used it to make several Amazon purchases. Then, when the device was down to about 3% battery, I charged it again for the second time. This time I turned off the keyboard's back light, because I'm a touch typist, and rarely look at my keyboard even when in almost complete dark. I then clicked on the battery icon, and changed the device settings to ""Recommended"". To my surprise, the device only marginally dimmed the screen brightness, but the result was that on my second charge, I got abut 8 1/2 hours of use. I could even go lower on the settings to ""Best Battery Life"", and it would probably push it to about 10 hours of use. I just choose NOT to do that, because then my display would be too dark to be enjoyable.The device keeps its charge intact when turned off, and inside my messenger bag for several hours every day.After the 3rd full charge, I am getting consistently, between 6.5 to 8.5 hours, depending on what software I'm running.I suspect that those manipulating large 3D creations in zbrush, or modo, will definitely see less battery hours than I.The kick stand is slightly less rigid than on the surface pro 4, but I see no wobble or any reason to feel insecure about it.The only reason I took 1 star from this review, is that after one week of use, now I have spotted a small point (The size of half a drop of water) on the screen, where I can see some faint back light bleed when on a completely black screen. Again, I can ONLY see it during the all black boot up screen, or if I REALLY look for it while watching movies with dark backgrounds, while on a room with all lights turned off. I cannot see this spot on any other circumstance. It is so faint, that I can't see it, even if I look for it during normal use. I'm a hard nitpicker, and probably would have thought about exchanging my unit, if I had noticed this the first day. But now that all my accounts are synched, I've downloaded all my applications and installed all my personal files on here... the hassle is not worth it. So, PLEASE check your screen as SOON as you boot it up for the first time, and you should be golden.To end on a happy note, I have to say that for a few days, I really contemplated getting the new Ipad pro instead of the surface pro.If you are a digital artist who ONLY wants a portable digital sketchbook, and you do NOT require the device for any serious work... then the ipad pro is probably the best option for you. Simply because the ipad pencil has a lower initial activation force for the pen. This makes it feel more natural when drawing. However, writing on either device feels quite similar. After a few days of comparisons, I had to move up to the Macbook pro as an alternative, because the ipad pro just didn't measure up to my personal and professional needs. But then I realized that the new Macbooks have NO legacy USB 3.0 ports, no Micro SD card slot, and only 2 USB C type ports. Welcome to dongles galore! I need my device to be as portable as possible. Having to carry around several adapter cables and dongles would really put a strain on my already cluttered bag. Not to mention that I would only be able to afford the 128GB model, which I know for sure is not enough for my needs. The 256GB on my surface pro, coupled with the ability to keep a 128gb SD cart permanently inserted in it for extra space, was just too good to pass up. Then I realized I would also lose the touch screen, and digital pen capabilities if I went with the Macbook pro. Next, the software compatibility issues between the MAC OS and some of the learning software that I use, meant that I would still have to install Windows on a partition of my Macbook pro. Then I would have to start dealing with itunes for my videos and audio files. No. Just NO. Too many negatives crept in, to the point where I felt that the Surface Pro was really tailor made for people like myself.In my case, I wanted a portable device that I could use not just for fun. But that I could use to take notes and draw graphs and images during lectures; use in work meetings as a digital white board while hooked to a projector; work out math/physics problems without having to waste paper; use to manipulate CAD or Photoshop images while on the go; compile and share PDFs or any other format work/school related documents, while having the ability to mark them up, highlight and share them easily; use for coding/programming; and that as an added bonus, could be used as a fun machine for watching movies and drawing/painting on the go.If you want a thin, sleek device that can REALLY replace your laptop, then the Surface Pro is the definite winner.In short, if you want an ultra portable device optimized for content creation, get the Surface Pro.If you want a portable device optimized for content consumption, then get the Ipad Pro.I have owned multiple phones, laptops, game consoles, portable game devices, both work and gaming computers etc...I'm so happy with this device, that this is the first time I have felt compelled to write a review for an electronic device ever.Good luck with your search.",0
"This unit was replacing an Asus 2 in 1 tablet with several years in service so my wife is not inexperienced user of this kind of devices. After several months in use she is still excited about how good her Surface Pro is. I had been asking frequently about any cons she could found but still nothing had disliked her and I still receive full credit by the gift selection. So in short, great device for an experience diverse user, and I'm thinking about to get a replacement for my Surface 3.",1
"My surface pro 3 began showing signs of failure after a few of years of hard service. This is an awesome upgrade to say the least. Exact same specs as the unit it replaced but this new Surface pro is smooth as butter and the fanless cooling is also a very nice upgrade. The surface pro 3 was not terribly noisy under a load but as they say silence is golden. It seems like Microsoft catches a fair amount of negativity, but they sure make a tablet that is a rock solid laptop alternative.",1
Excllent product.  Love the touch screen - also that you can use in tablet or in laptop mode.  Worth the money.,0
Wow.  Just wow.  This unit has as much power as a laptop and is so portable.  Will never go back to laptop.,0
I'm in love. Excited to continue exploring my new Microsoft Surface Pro!,1
Not much I can say here. I freaking love this thing (and I was an all Apple person before deciding to buy it).,1
Unlike most products is worth the money and lives up to the hype.,1
"love my Surface Pro. Use it all the time. Sleek design, great quality, Easy to use !",0
"This surface pro is great.  I use it all the time.  What I really like is the tablet features and yet I can still run normal programs on it.  In the last few years I’ve had an ipad, a Samsung tablet, and I have to say this surface pro is better than them hands down.With my other tablets all I could is apps and hope that someone made a program similar to one on my pc that I could use.  All the apps never matched up to the actual program that would run on a pc.  This is the main reason I purchased this over getting another tablet.  Sure tablets are great and easy to use but they lack the power and operating systems that make them actual functioning computers.If you’re looking for something to go beyond the basic tablet I would suggest getting the surface.  The interface is windows which most people know.  The stylus and screen work great together and the batter life is good.  The only down side I would have to say about it has to do with windows 10.  I wish it had a better tablet interface but the added ability of switching to basic computer mode more than off sets this draw back.  Over all I would say it’s been a great purchase",1
"Love this computer/tablet, light and long lasting battery.",1
Excllent product.  Love the touch screen - also that you can use in tablet or in laptop mode.  Worth the money.,1
A great laptop. Well holds a charge. The sound of the display is so good. Perfect keyboard a touchpad.I recommend to buy. The stylus turned out to be really cool. The quality of the materials and the assembly are exactly one of the best.,1
"I love this thing. Very fast, Great display.  No problems with it.",1
Beautiful tablet,0
Great item works good.,1
Everything that I expected and more. I would recommend to anyone looking for a powerful PC experience in a compact package.,1
"This is, by far, the best purchase I've made when it comes to computers. I wanted to buy this product for my video editing. I had a desktop that was powerful enough to do the editing that I needed done, however I struggled to do my edits when my desktop was in a place away from the rest of my family and I couldn't move it. I decided to go with the Surface Pro, i5, because it would do the basics. Once I started using the Surface, I quickly realized that it would do more than just the basics. This is certainly my go-to computer now. I love editing pictures and video on it with Adobe software, I love surfing the internet with it and I love using it to take notes on various different things. I did purchase the Surface refurbished, and I'm so happy I did. I also bought accessories that were not Microsoft. Doing these two things saved me between $300-$400 total and I wouldn't change any of that at this point.I wanted to give it some time before I posted my review. I've had it for nearly two months and I absolutely love it. It's still the easiest laptop to carry around and work on. It also does the job I need it to do, no matter what that is. I remember someone in college bragging about this computer and I laughed at them, thinking they were crazy for choosing this over some other laptop. While I'm glad I waited for this particular model, I am SO thankful I purchased it! Definitely the best decision I've made for my video editing.",1
Thanks,1
Well i just got this and started using it it seems to be a good product my only concern is ive noticed what seems like screen flickering a bit or its dimming a bit when i type only noticed this when it was off the charger so who knows may be nothing. I will update this review later,0
"Works  well and uses the  window 10 pro software. - Good solid, stable  tablet.",0
This item came in great condition and I definitely would recommend it. I look forward for future purchases. Thank you,1
"Love it! This device replaced my original Surface Pro 3. Very fast, very lightweight. Great design. This is my primary computer, and it does everything well. Can't run high end games (1GB video RAM), but it runs the ones I like (Rocket League and Cuphead) well, along with some others.",1
"Now it is trying to be Android like but some of us don't like Android products.  The icons were so well positioned, clear, large and easy to navigate.  Now everything is intended to be similar to Google products, which some of us cannot stand.  It is all about tracking that has to be undone in so many areas.  It is more about restrictions than freedom of navigation.  It is interesting that these companies and their IT departments are not focused on making the experience better for us the end user but what they can get out of it.  I bought this because my original Surface Pro is getting old but I much prefer using the old one and use it more than the new one.  For ex. there used to be a YouTube feature without ads may because of Ggle's purchase since, there used to be no annoying disturbances from Cortana, an overly intrusive 'assistant' which only disturbs and doesn't assist at all.  Expect to spend sometime to undo all these annoying features.  But if you are used to Android, may be you don't mind.  Some of us like to use this as a professional tool, go to the essential and not have the maker of the tablet waste our time needlessly for whatever tracking purpose they may have.  Some of these devices are called ""smart"" but they are in the end just machines and should act like it.",1
"I was looking for a small but reliable laptop. While the price was a bit more than I wanted to pay, it’s a great value and I’m happy with it. I was a bit skiddish of going tablet with keyboard but this worry proved to be nothing. I’ve found the Pro to be big enough and fast enough to do what I needed.",1
"This is a classic ""you get what you pay for"" sort of situation. I purchased the m3 model with 4GB of RAM for a little under $600. This thing is great: it's portable, high-quality, stylish, and seems durable enough, but it's performance lags compared to my other laptops. If I had sprung for the i5 with 8 GB model, I'm sure I would have nothing to complain about, but I couldn't justify pretty much doubling what I was going to spend.Sure, you can't have 18 Chrome tabs open with Excel running while you watch a Twitch Stream--but you can do anything a normal college student would require of a laptop.",1
"I have had several versions of the Surface Pro (SP1, SP3, SP2017 i5 and now SP2017 i7. With the exception of the first, they have all been excellent computers when matched to the right needs. I love the small size and light weight in a genuine Windows computer and really value it’s portability. I use it as a laptop with the keyboard cover, and as a desktop via the Surface docking station (i.e. using an external large monitor and full-sized external keyboard. I love that the screen is touch, but I don't use it as a pure tablet very often. Occasionally, I'll grab the Surface stylus and use it to edit an image in Photoshop, but I also have a 9.7” iPad Pro that I like better as a pure tablet. Overall, it is an excellent device and I highly recommend it.The one extra comment I will make is that I first bought the i5 version of this because I didn’t want the one with the fan. However, the graphics in that version tended to drag a bit when I was using Photoshop. I went ahead and bought this i7 version for the faster GPU (integrated into the CPU) and I have to say that I shouldn't have been worried about the fan. It rarely runs and I never hear it when it does. If you don’t need something that computationally needs the i7 or the faster GPU, then the i5 is perfect. It's more than fast enough for everything else I did, and it gives you more bang for the buck. But if you do need the additional power of the i7, don’t let the fan thing put you off.One last note... I only gave the sound 3 stars. I should clarify that there is nothing wrong with the sound. It's probably as good as you could expect from the tiny speakers in the edge of a tablet. It's not spectacular, but it's fine... as good as my iPad Pro. Still, it's hard to give it five stars just because that would mean it was exceptional and it's not. If you're going to listen to music, you'll want earbuds, headphones or an external speaker.",1
"I was reluctant before buying it because everybody said it was a tablet and it was similar to IPad Pro. Well let me tell you that the machine is looking waaay slimmer than other laptops in it's range and here I was comparing it most with Dell XPS 13"".Working for a banking institution I'm using it to finish my reports at home and also work during weekend on it and I am super delighted to work on it being so easy to carry around and use. The power it's also great never had any errors or troubles with it. I like it a lot!",1
"Love the portability of the tablet. Love the power of the tablet. For reference I have a dell laptop that's only a year old, and this surface has the same power the laptop has. I can do everything I need from the surface.Note that I did not buy the docking station because I intended this to be a ""travel laptop"" to keep me from having to lug my laptop home nightly. Having said that, my only knock against it is the screen size. I could really use another few inches on the screen. Having said that, I could buy the docking station and solve the issue.Love the tablet. Expensive but for someone who travels out of town every few weeks and wants something more than a phone to check emails at night, it's worth it.",0
Good windows experience which doubles as a tablet. Keyboard is nicer than I expected and the attaching mechanism works without issues.,1
Very happy with the purchase. 1st of all the seller was excellent. Ensured me that the product is authentic and brand new and replied to all my queries. Product is indeed brand new and was registered with 1 year warranty through microsoft website. Props tp seller. Amazon did ship the item quickly and handled international shipping with zero import fee deposit. The product has been great so far. Best 2 in 1 device I have ever used and has been such a companion for my academic work and business work.,0
"I only use my Surface for digital drawing with a Surface Pen in Photoshop CC 2019, and so far it has worked mostly great! I bought the I5 with 8 gigs of RAM, and I would say that is the absolute minimum specs I would go for, for heavy Photoshop usage. Depending on what I am doing, PS will lag a bit at times.  Battery life is OK, I can get maybe 4 or 5 hours out of a charge.  Drawing on this screen is NOT true to life, but it is super milky smooth and I love it.  I need the screen to be pretty bright when I'm drawing, which of course burns more battery. I feel like the standard screen brightness setting is not enough.Before I bought this I was worried that the stand wouldn't be good enough, but it is great, I love it.Another thing I appreciate is that this tablet comes with much less bloatware than, say, your standard Dell laptop.Speakers are nothing to write home about, not surprisingly.I will update this review as I use this tablet more.",0
"I got the i7 2017 surface 16Gb to replace my ageing Alienware which was like a brick to play blizzard games at LAN parties. I can honestly say I've never been more satisfied with a portable computer purchase. So far we've been doing Starcraft remastered, Starcraft 2, overwatch, and Heros of the storm and the only occasional issue I've seen is when I start the games the active mouse region is inappropriately mapped to the pixel resolution and not to the scaled game resolution as the surface has a high resolution display and will by default scale each app so they appear properly. I have discovered that using Alt tab to switch to the desktop and back quickly fixes this issue. The games seem to detect that I am not using a discrete graphics card and automatically configure themselves for the lowest settings which do no bother me at all. A feature that I like is the facial recognition since it takes no effort to login. This is a huge convenience because I only use this system for LAN parties and web browsing and really don't want to spend a lot of time typing in passwords over and over again. Really makes this feel like a futuristic biometric signature. I hope Microsoft continues making incredible stuff like this.I got this system with its keyboard and arc mouse and pen and they work great.",0
Excellent tablet/laptop - screen is very nice too.,1
"This has quickly become my everyday note-taking tool. It's great as a science major because most of my lectures are powerpoint/picture/diagram based. Integration with OneNote makes this machine an impeccable tool for excellent performance in these classes. If you're looking for something to invest in to improve your college experience, this is exactly you're looking for.",1
"This is my third Surface Pro unit.  I upgraded from a Surface 3 to a Surface 4 to the 2017 Surface Pro.  All were i7 tablets and I had no issues with any of them.  This one, as the others, has a beautiful screen, boots up quickly and runs quite fast.  It's definitely the best of the three I've owned. This is my go to travel unit due to it's size and weight.  I also purchased a new alcantra keyboard which also works quite well.  It's a little pricey but worth it to me because of it versatility.  I highly recommend it.",0
just as advertised,1
"very cool, very great!",1
Had to replace SP3 when screen glass cracked (still use it but no touchscreen now). Even better than the original... great!,0
"I really like the laptop. Like the weight, and the size and how everything holds together, the keyboard is great the pen attaches to it. Powerful enough for what I need it. Runs photoshop well too on the M3. Happy with it.",1
"Great for my travels, converts between a tablet or notebook depending on my needs or works space. Battery life has been really good so far.",1
"I needed a new laptop and wanted something with a touch screen I can write on and I couldn't be happier with the Surface. It runs windows 10, which is the operating system I prefer. The SSD starts up super fast. It's incredibly light.  The screen looks great. The accessories are a bit pricey (unless you compare to apple) but I bought the keyboard, pen, and fold able mouse for Surface and I'd recommend them all. The mouse is very optional but very cool and useful, but the trackpad on the keyboard works just as well as any other modern trackpad. I'd recommend the Surface for anyone who carries a laptop around daily for school or work.",0
"Great picture, fast speed,  still not a fan of windows 10.",1
"fast efficient, amazing pen response- better than my cintiq. runs surprisingly  cool for I7 16gb ram model. Just wish it had usb-c but not a deal breaker for me",1
"After a little over a week of use, this is one fantastic device.  I am extremely pleased.  Perfect size for portability along with usability, at least for my purposes.  Great screen resolution and seems to run every bit as fast as my Intel i7 powered HP desktop.",0
"I Love that it came in the original box, it was all brand new & unused.",0
This PC works exactly as I expected. No complaints at all. I'm glad I went for this model.,1
"muy buen producto, versatil y 100 % recomendable. Liviano y excelente calidad.",1
"Awesome! I wish I had purchased one MUCH sooner! In addition to all the great features and ease of use, I especially like that I can keep it powered on during airline flights from gate to gate. It is not considered a ""larger portable electronic device,"" so I do not have to power it down or stow it. This allows me to make good use of all the available on a flight.",0
This model is fast and has improved battery life over previous iterations.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a mobile computer.,1
Bought this item slightly used and I can barely tell if it was used all. Excellent condition and excellent performance for money thus far. Will purchase again,0
A great combination of productivity and small size. I like the screen and type cover especially.,1
Awesome ! I bought this for HVAC sales. Works great impressive to the customer! Paired it with a Canon portable printer. Less time to do after hours service billings and proposals= more money and more time with the family! Upgrade from that hand written invoice for more sales!,0
"Product is really nice I use it for my daily use, watch videos, Netflix and prime videos in free time or traveling. Really good product and snappy.",1
"good product,  highly recommended.",0
"I almost got a macbook because I am an iPhone user. However due to Mac's crazy prices, I got a surface. I absolutely love it, and it even syncs all my photos from my iPhone. the sketch apps are amazing and the touch sensitivity is almost that of using pen and paper. Well worth the money, one of my best purchases ever.",1
Great tablet,1
Great machine,1
"I love this laptop! I did a lot of research before purchasing since I don’t know a lot about computer specs. I wasn’t sure what storage or speed would be appropriate but not overboard for my general purposes. It’s lightweight and the easiest setup possible. The facial recognition feature is great although it didn’t recognize me after I took my makeup off and put my hair up so we had to do another visual. Now it recognizes me every time! It’s fast and incredibly easy to use. I’m not a gamer but for general internet usage, movies, writing the storage capacity and speed are great. I’m not a huge fan of the windows tiles home screen but that isn’t really the laptops fault. Overall it’s definitely worth it and I’ve already recommended it to a few friends.",0
