"I've wanted a MacBook for a while now because of the build quality and the simplicity of the OS. I spend an average 6 hours a day using it for college and the battery still has a fair charge left. The screen looks great. ​Apple does a great job of integrating their products. Being able to unlock my laptop using my watch is great. It’s pricy, but I guess you're also paying for the brandWhen you think of Apple you automatically think expensive if your anything like me. When purchasing this lap...READ MORE",1

"very good product (light weight, high battery back up, reliable mac os, fast speed due to SSD and 8GB RAM, and doesn't heat up when used for long, and going by history of the product it should sustain all these good points even after years, unlike other laptops that deteriorate after few months or couple of years) and then unbeatable price as I bought it at final price of 48.5kREAD MORE",1
"It seemed to be a very good deal initially. It worked perfectly for few months. However, screen got damaged due to water. Apple store was asking for 44k to replace screen.

This is my first apple product and I bought this laptop on exchange with the my old hp laptop. My experience on very first day few keys are not working and I reached out to the Flipkart and they gave me response stating to visit and nearest mac service center. There is no replacement for the product and the solution for this fix is they need to replace whole keyboard.
