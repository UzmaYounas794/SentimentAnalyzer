"I'm writing this after a month of usage (gaming+editing+office+coding)Pros :1) Ryzen 5 5500u is way better than the older 3500h and you can actually feel the difference (my friend have 3500h variant). 2) 1660 gfx card under this price segment is a bang for buck. I had no problems playing AAA games with maxed graphics at 50+ fps. Older games like GTA 5, CSGO etc are smoother than ever. Even Minecraft with heavy texture packs runs smoothly.3) Editing ofcourse you can edit efficiently as the...READ MORE",1

"I've had this laptop for a month now and I'm all praises for this one. The hardware is the best you can get at this price point. The battery backup is pretty good, and in my one month of usage I've never faced any heating issues. The matte display is great, but the brightness is not adequate for outdoor usage. The speaker quality and sound is pretty decent too. Also, the keyboard is a little compact for my liking (most people won't find that to be a problem).

"October 2021.Bought it for 51k. Good deal for upto 55k. Everything is perfect abt the laptop only con i found is the overtime durability of the hinge or it can only be the the tightness of it for easy one hand opening (i don‚Äôt think there will be problems with it)because it feels kind of flimsy, rest of the build quality is good. Definitely use a cooling pad if u r a regular heavy user or gamer.READ MORE",1

Only one word - Superb!It boots up lightening fast and ready to use in just 5-8 seconds. Freaking awesome speed! All the games and apps that i have tried ran smoothly as expected and sometimes beyond expectations. The two downsides are its poor webcam ( which we never use) and the battery. The battery runs out very fast while gaming. 1-2 hours. Otherwise for normal use it will stay up for at least 5-7 hours. You can watch detailed performance reviews on YouTube and all of them are mostly true.READ MORE,1

Guys if you are a heavy gamer... Then u must not be here... As this price segment is not for heavy gamers... But if you are a casual gamer then trust me guys go with acer aspire 7 ryzen 5500u...

And the msi gf63 thin with i5 9th Gen has a max q processor which is still not good for gaming compared to acer aspire 7 ryzen 5500u.... And you will only get 3 to 4 hrs of battery ...READ MORE,1

Just go for it rumores about weak battery is false i have been using this laptop for almost 1 month and on normal usage 8 to 9 hours and it takes 1 and a half hour to get fully charged but speakers are weak so you're gonna need a separate speaker and other than speaker everything runs absolutely perfectREAD MORE,1
