"The laptop takes is a good one. It takes some time to set up the first time. You have to wait a lot. But, once you are done with that, you don't experience it again. Moreover, there'll be issues with the speed. The laptop Will freeze at times. But, you can overcome this by shrinking the size of the C drive. It's initially 931 GB.

Bought this for online classes. Hardly used it as there was summer holidays. The charging port was loose and wasn't charging properly. Tried with other Dell charger same issue. Connected with Dell Support - they confirmed the port was loose. However refused to repair it under warranty!This is not even 2 months old !! with very less usage and the port is already damaged.Either the company/seller gave a defective piece or this product's durability is just horribleREAD MORE,0
