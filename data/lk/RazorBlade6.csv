"I’ve only really ran wow on this computer so far so I can’t say it’s crazy good for gaming but so far I’m loving this computer. Supper fast and great looking design. My first razer computer, but needless to say I’ve been eyeing razer for a while and I’m glad Amazon prime day happened because this was only 950$. So far a great deal",1
"After about a week of use, I decided to return it. Reviews said that Razer has put a really aggressive undervolt and power limit, but for some reason my unit just regularly hit 100C. I even downloaded throttlestop to try to work it out myself but to no avail. I was able to undervolt and get 1w idle power draw and a consistent 7 hours of battery life. The other thing I found really weird is how hollow it feels. Don't get me wrong, its dense and heavy, but wherever you tap on it with a fingernail, it sounds like plastic. Don't get me wrong, its the nicest built windows gaming laptop but compared to a mbp, the finish is just not there. Lastly, the keyboard is just really weird. Shift row of keys is shifted to the left 0.25 key lengths and it makes switching between my laptop and desktop keyboard harder than it should be.",1
"The battery life I’m getting is around 4 hours on a full charge with low performance. It is super thin and light, however, the main concern I have is the amount of heat it produces.Even though this laptop is supposed to have better thermals than the base model, when you crank the GPU up, the fans will kick it up to around 85-90C. (Hot enough to burn your hands).The reason for this is due to how thin the laptop is. Due to this, the laptop isn’t able to cool itself as well as the thicker variants. Do take this in mind before purchasing.Overall : Solid laptop, just remember that you’ll probably want to get a cooling pad, do whatever you can to make sure it stays as cool as possible.",1
"Living on a sailboat I've had to give up desktop pc's for laptops. I've had many over the years, usually top of the line beefy monsters. They were cumbersome and I always looked like ""that guy"" at work. After an unfortunate motorcycle accident that destroyed my 17"" Clevo (6 core I7 and full 2070) I started looking for something that could not only game, but was also portable and not so flashy at work (The unicorn). I was extremely nervous about the thermals, razer doesn't have a good reputation in that department. But to my surprise I haven't seen temps above 88c on the cpu. This is while playing games like Star Citizen, Arma 3, etc. Although its only been a few weeks of ownership, I couldn't be happier with this slim monster. The battery life is around 5 hours and gets me through a work day no problem (google sheets, scheduling and fleet tracking). PD charging is also extremely convenient if you're tight on space, but honestly the power brick is super small already. Only time will tell for longevity. The fingerprints are horrible, I'll be buying a debrand skin to not only protect from scratches but also my oily ass hands. My only real gripe is having only one storage drive slot, I really would have like 2x M.2's for raid 0 but that's just me being picky.",0
Nice entry level gaming laptop. Battery life is okay for basic data entry or web surfing but dies fast when playing any game.,1
"Payed USD1099 for this Razer base model. At that price this is a steal, at USD 1199 is an excellent purchage but at the original price of USD1599 not worth the money. The SSD included is really low performance. If you plan to really game with this laptop buy a new NVMe ssd storage.Amazing how BAD the sound of the speakers in this laptop, terrible terrible bad quality sound. Not sure why Razer use THX...",1
"Battery life is non-existent in the unit I recievedI've owned this laptop for six months and within those six months I've had 4 separate occasions where the laptop will not recognize the charger. The battery will not drain when it's connected, but this causes the computer to run at bare minimum specs since it believes its on battery. For example, with no settings changed, previously I was running Control at 200 FPS and I can't run Phasmophobia (a lower spec game) higher than 2 FPS....YES ""2""!!!Razer tech support was of little help, they want to troubleshoot the software when it is a hardware issue.Currently, this laptop is just a $3000 paperweight.",1
"so happy with the laptop, had an asus and an Alienware prior to the razer and its in a different league to them interms of build quality",1
"It is a very powerfull machine, but It is imposible use it on warm clime like caribean countries. I recomend a notebook not so pwerfull and other desktop machine for games.",1
" I really wanted to like this laptop, I am generally a fan of Razer and have used their products off and on for many years. I was asking for a lot when I decided to purchase this laptop but nothing that wasn’t promised in the Amazon advertising, I was looking for a sleek/quiet/yet powerful laptop that I can use for browsing/gaming. In an attempt to make sure the laptop would be able to handle my requests I even opted for the “advanced” model. This laptop LOOKS great from a physical standpoint and appears quite powerful when it comes to gaming. However, from the first day I tried this laptop I had doubts about whether my purchase was worth it. Even after removing all bloatware and ending all non-essential tasks this laptop IDLES at ~40% memory usage (6-6.5/ 16GB). The laptop is fairly quiet while idle but definitely not silent, and the second any program boots (game/discord/chrome) it will immediately kick in the fans at an obnoxious volume under default razer settings. There are options within razer synapse to manually reduce fan speed which makes the laptop quieter but at the cost of more heat. With the fans on auto (loud) this laptop still generates noticeable heat while idling and over 15-20 minutes reaches near skin-burning temperatures while playing minecraft on the lowest settings, keep in mind this laptop still retails for $2000-2500, that is unacceptable performance for this price point. Additionally, on my second day using this laptop (mind you this is still on default fan settings while playing minecraft on the lowest settings with native resolution) the GPU overheated and crashed the laptop/blackscreened until force shutdown and then needed to wait to cool down before being rebooted. I believe the actual specs of the laptop should be able to handle a heavy workload but the design of this laptop does not supply adequate cooling/heat reduction, especially not without making enough noise to drown out an entire room. Lastly, just a few extra annoyances, the webcam quality is real bad, it looks comparable to my 360p Logitech from the 2000’s. The built-in speakers are laughably awful but that wasn’t a big deal for me as I always use my laptop with headphones. The laptop requires you to not only keep and use the Razer bloatware to customize things like keyboard color/brightness (not super uncommon) but it also must remain running at all times in order to even do things as simple as lower the screen brightness using the function keys. In the end, I may give Razer a try again in the future but I will be taking another deserved break from trying their products after this one.Attached images of startup RAM usage and black screen from overheating.

"I was hoping to get an advanced for a while, as I like the slimmer look, vapor chamber cooling, eight cores and ability to charge via USB-C. Only thing, they are much more pricey than the chunky base models. Amazon Warehouse had an ""acceptable"" condition one, which means there may have been some scratches etc. Other than the look, which I was fine with having ordered a skin regardless, the laptop works perfectly.Quiet and cool when casual use (like office and college work), yes it gets hot and audible when gaming or editing, but in an all metal body this slim, it really is to be expected. Battery life is nothing fantastic, but fine for a medium coffeeshop stay or a flight wait. This is not an Ultrabook after all, with a GPU and a big screen. The keyboard lighting is brighter on the advanced model too. Oh and upgrading the computer is super easy.To sum, give Amazon Warehouse deals ago, as you can get a great product, with 90 warranty / returns and save some cash. Best purchase I have made in 2021.",1
"This is exactly what you think it is. A very well designed powerful gaming laptop. The chassis looks and feels awesome, gaming on desktop, steam, stadia is incredible and Razer technical support is top notch. Added bonus is having this laptop when everyone else at the coffee shop has a Mac.",0
Love this gaming laptop. The battery life is awesome. Just make sure you get a good fan for this laptop as it can get pretty hot.,0
Bought for my daughter for her gaming and she loves it. The games no longer have any lag or clipping which was triggering her vertigo. Her only complaint is that when playing any game that she only gets around 2 hours of battery use so she keeps it on the charger when its on.,1

"Laptop does not turn on, and Amazon tech support was useless, unable to tell me any more than what the first two search results on YouTube. I purchased a used laptop from Amazon expecting that it most likely wouldn’t be perfect but I expected it should at least turn on. Are they not even testing these before they go out to make sure they work? I know it’s not the adapter as it lights up, but the laptop does nothing but blink a white light if you hold the power button for 10 seconds, which according to Amazon, should fix it, but that does not appear to be the case. I’m already very frustrated since this was a replacement for a NEW laptop that was lost by the shipper (UPS) that Amazon did not have in stock anymore.",1
only thing I dont like it dose put out a lot of heat.  Over all a great computor,1

"I do cooking streams, and this laptop gets the job done! I have not ran any game play on it yet, but may in the future!",0
"I'm really happy with this computer. I'm not a gamer but have to run several programs at once so a friend recommended this. The color changing keyboard is super cool and the laptop is very sleek and nice looking. Battery life and performance are great. It's a bit heavy but very sturdy. My only complaint is that the track pad is a bit large so I'll accidentally hit it sometimes while I'm typing. If you use an external mouse, though, you can disable the track pad so it's not as much of a problem. Overall would highly recommend.",1
"Pros: The laptop itself is solid, great specs, good screen, well put together inside of an aluminum shell. IT is somewhat lightweight compared to others in the same class. It does offer charge from USB-C. It comes with a 1 year limited warranty.Cons: Technical support is lackluster. There is a large area of distrust, a heavy reliance on providing video proof. Support is slow responding. Hope that you do not have to do an RMA. Additionally, RazerCare, the extended warranty is not available from third party resellers after initial purchase.Charging: While it can do a trickle charge from USB-C at 100w, it is insufficient to charge while the laptop is under load. To adequately charge, you will need to use the 230w AC Adapter. This provides challenges as a docking station, even from Razer, provides insufficient power for this laptop.Quality issues: The AC Adapter went out after less than 3.5 months of use. Contact support and they want a video of it not working so that they can start the RMA process. As a heads-up that means that you send in your part, once they receive it, they repair or replace and then you will get a return. If they receive it. If they don't you get nothing.Intangibles: Windows had display issues from day 1, where the Optimus driver did not work with the laptop monitor. This required a bypass by using an external monitor. Once into Windows you can either use the Synapse software or simply go into the BIOS to adjust it to using the dedicated GPU.  This works fine, but will reduce battery life to a pedestrian 1-1.5 hours if you do more than light web browsing. If you want a gaming machine, this is not a deal breaker. If you are wanting something transitioning between gaming and other stuff, this might present serious issues.",1
"Boutht it at 1.5k, considering what you get with this money when buying desktop, its a bargain. 2080 super outperforms 3050ti and performs similar to 3060ti desktop. Great value for money",0
Our gamer loved it,1
I absolutely love this laptop. does get a little hot when using graphically heavy games but I expected that. battery only lasts about 2 hours when not charging but i also accounted for that as well.  all around though wouldn't choose any other laptop personally.,1
"I've had a lot of computers and laptops over the past 30 years. One thing that has gotten progressively worse (and annoying) is all the bloatware. Almost every manufacturer ads their own support aps, anti virus, market place, etc. All they do it slow it down and bug up the system.This is my first Razer and I'm never going back. They only ad 1 app and that's to program all the RGBs and tweak the system performance. It's a subtle app too.Combined with the great hardware they put in their systems, the build quality is what really sets it apart. I got mine for engineering work. Other brands add an ""enterprise tax"" to anything they say I'd for professional use or if it mentions CAD in the description.I run Fusion 360 on this with no issues. Renders like butter too.",1
The battery life is really great for this laptop! It runs so smoothly and I am very happy with it overall. The RGB keyboard and glowing Razer symbol in the back are super cool features as well!,0
Works great for gaming cab run most games on ultra high settings without lag or for drops. However if planing on using laptop for gaming on hours just keep in mind it runs really hot and you may want to purcahse a laptop cooler with the laptop. The battery life is good hoever has an artist I wish it were a bit longer. Sleep mode turns the pc rgb keyboard and razor logo backight off.,1

"An excellent little laptop, but I got two small defects in a row. that's simply not acceptable when I'm paying this much money. Overall, everything is pretty good, and the internals are very powerful. It's a really nice machine. Just don't buy it from here.",0
"Fantastic Quality gaming laptop. Black aluminum casing. Great keyboard layout and large touchpad. When gaming, it does get very hot towards the back and on the bottom. Highly recommend a basic laptop stand",0
"Got the laptop on Prime Day, so have had it over 5 months.  Pretty solid laptop that I use for work.  MAJOR downfall is, me and more seasoned computer people than I, cannot get more than 1 external monitor to connect.  I deal with spreadsheets all day and need 2 external monitors.  1 HDMI port works great, connecting a monitor thru the USB-C ports just doesnt work.  Had I known this I would not have purchased so disappointed in this laptop.  If you dont need 2 external monitors, it works great for normal computer use.  I dont game, so no clue there.",1

"So I bought this towards the end of last year and let me tell you: This runs a LOT better than my old PC. I bought it initially so I could bring it with me to petsittings (I house sit dogs for a living) and I have been able to start my portfolio in voice acting as a result! If you want a good PC for gaming and to re-discover old hobbies you forgot you loved, BUY THIS GAMING DESKTOP! It is also super easy to buy an SSD card for more memory and the like on here if you'd like. If I had one complaint, it is simply that it comes without an ethernet port, but this is easy to remedy, I assure you!",0

Great,1
Got the razer laptop and I already fell in love with it.,1
" Just purchased my first Razer in Sept.  I always been a Mac kind of person but wanted to give a gaming laptop a chance. The laptop has a problem charging. I am unsure if is the charger or the battery but as soon as I start playing something the battery gets low and then when I plug it in it start doing this crazy thing in which it charges and stops charging, prompting a notification on the screen that does not let me game or complete any kind of work. I am very disappointed and frustrated.",1
Arrived well packaged and undamaged. Specs are as advertised. One month of use with no issues,1
"Love that this is sturdy, light weight and aluminum metal covered and I don't think I'll have broken hinges in a year or two like my last two plastic gaming laptops.  That was my biggest concern in looking for a gaming laptop I could use to game a little but mostly to quickly photo edit and use photo shop when on the road.  It is extremely fast, out does my desktop and is now out of 4 pc's the one I use.  It's so quick I can't handle waiting on the others. Last years graphics is fine for the saving I garnered.  I'm a firm believer in I'd still be happy with my last years pc this year.  I easily installed a 2 TB m2 hard drive in the extra slot (love it has an empty slot for that) and the 16 GB ram seems to run my photo editing with fine speed and my older games.  This does not have thunderbolt to connect a display through the C port but has two type C ports that I use to connect all peripherals and then just use the hdmi to connect one monitor and use the laptop screen as a second so don't purchase a C type universal docking station to connect displays, display put through won't work on this 2020 model, i believe it has been updated by razer to work on the 2021 models.  Very very happy with this purchase for my needs.  Oh i thought I would miss the number bad, especially when photo editing but i've adapted to that quickly and do not miss it.",1

"I'm a graphic designer and video editor, so I wanted a laptop that could handle having 5 Adobe programs open without pooping out, and that, unlike Mac, could be upgraded and also run games. This was an investment purchase I hoped to use for a long time.I'm still in the over-cautious phase of the big purchase and have only used the laptop at a desk and sitting upright, I've been cautious about not over-charging even though it claims to have a system that protects from over-charging, and kept the charging cable untangled and didn't really move it while plugged in. So color me surprised when in just under a month, the battery stopped charging and the laptop died as soon as it was unplugged.After some googling and forums I initially brushed off as 1/10000 chances when I was researching laptops, this battery issue has been a problem since 2015 that they still haven't solved. Customer service troubleshot the problem to be the charging port., Don't bother emailing them because they say to wait three days or more for a response over email. Instead, I used their chat feature in customer service and the guy was nice enough and walked me through some troubleshooting to figure out the problem that I had to describe like three times. He assumed I just had a 100W USB-C cable on hand to use as a secondary charging device, something not included with the laptop, which also didn't work. And now I have to send out a laptop I bought LESS THAN A MONTH AGO for repair that could take 2 weeks, half the time I've had the laptop.UPDATE:The customer service team is clearly run out of the USA, likely India. They have absolutely no skill or authority to talk about issues and use weird, confusing phrases, and never respond to questions. Iconic phrases such as:""the Battery that needs to be replaced is out of stock."", followed by an email the next day saying, ""We received an update from our Repair Team that the battery has been replenished."" Which then took three emails asking if that means the battery has been replaced or not, one of which contained a request for information on refunds because I did not want a laptop with the same broken battery. One of those emails even said 'Sorry for the confusion!' then proceeded to not clear up anything at all.When they did answer it, what I got was ""With regard to your query, by the time our team inspected your unit with faulty battery, we haven't had stocks for the battery parts yet. That was why, you were offered with the unit replacement instead. For some reason, our parts have been restocked,"" So, for some reason parts were restocked. And I was brushed off on my concerns. Any questions about returns were directed to their website, so clearly the customer support team has no authority to actually do anything or answer any questions.All of it is sprinkled in with a frustratingly upbeat ""Hope your day is as good as mine."" and ""Giving you excellent service is always a pleasure."" I'm having to pass up freelance work and not getting questions answered, so no, my day isn't going great and I'm not getting excellent service, but good luck finding someone at Razer to express that too because the customer service team doesn't even read emails.",0

"In terms of what I like... The quality feel, the performance, the fact this model includes Windows Hello facial recognition camera, and the lack of tons of junk pre-installed. This thing performs like a champ for what I'm using it to do.In terms of what I dislike... not much. Battery isn't as good as a less performant device, but that's obvious considering it's a high powered gaming laptop. No, what I dislike most is the custom power adapter connector instead of a more common connector like what Dell, HP, and others use. This isn't a problem for the one that comes with the laptop, but if you're like me and want to order extras or need to replace it, they're very expensive.",1

"It's time we all realize that Razer makes bad products. For the last 4 years issues with Battery Swelling, overheating and terrible customer service have loomed around us but we discard those due to style, at least I did and I'm paying the price. New system with a bloated battery and bad screen right out the gate and trying to get support from Razer is harder then getting health insurance to cover cosmetic surgery. Razer, step it up!",1
"This laptop is amazing. From the looks to how it performs. The keyboard doesn’t travel as deep when you push the keys compared to other laptops I have used. However they feel nice to type on. Also I really like the color profiles in synapse. I’m getting great battery life with power saving settings. I’m getting around 5 -6 hours. When I’m plugged into the wall and I have the fans all the way up and the cpu and gpu are on high. I was getting around 130-150 FPS in death stranding,  With the settings all the way up in the game. It looked amazing and performed great. Overall, I’m happy I got this laptop.",0
Has been working solidly for the couple of months I've had it so far. Great computer for school its fast and powerful with lots of storage.,1

"Great laptop, especially at its price. Only complaints are that it runs so hot you need to be careful where you set it, and the keyboard is missing the home and end keys. I’d definitely buy it again if given the choice. The battery performs as advertised which is pretty decent considering what’s under the hood.",1
"The battery life I’m getting is around 4 hours on a full charge with low performance. It is super thin and light, however, the main concern I have is the amount of heat it produces.Even though this laptop is supposed to have better thermals than the base model, when you crank the GPU up, the fans will kick it up to around 85-90C. (Hot enough to burn your hands).The reason for this is due to how thin the laptop is. Due to this, the laptop isn’t able to cool itself as well as the thicker variants. Do take this in mind before purchasing.Overall : Solid laptop, just remember that you’ll probably want to get a cooling pad, do whatever you can to make sure it stays as cool as possible.",1
"Bought 2 of the 2080/1TB version and we are really enjoying them. I would think most people would know this, but this is a very thin and powerful laptop, so it is going to have high thermals, I would recommend using a laptop cooler as a stand for it. The build quality is great, the attention to details like the keyboards and software are great. I am really struggling to try to find something negative to say about this laptop. Maybe the price but I feel like if you are in the market for a clean/quality gaming laptop (or hard-working work laptop) with an aluminum finish, you are looking at this price tag already. Razer I think really nailed it with this laptop.",1

Great laptop. Performs exceptionally well. Gets hot quite fast so you will want a cooling pad. Battery life is ok depending on how you use it.,1
This item was purchased on July 24 and Wifi Adapter did not last 3 full months (went out on October 6).  When seeking support was told no longer under warranty and to contact Razer.  Razer informed me that this is not an authorized dealer.  Repairs could be completed but would be at cost.  This is unacceptable that even a refurbished item did not last 3 months.  This happened to 2 of the 3 laptops purchased.  Can not help but feel like I was scammed on this order.,1
"I thought I'd bought a nice laptop. It was, for about 24 hours.I was excited to grab this sleek, well-equipped system for $999 on Prime Day 2021 for work and some light gaming; it was in my hands the next day.

Or should I send the entire system to Razer for a simple exchange?""Late that night, I got back a copy/pasted list of questions, some of which I had already answered in the initial message (e.g. ""When did the issue start occurring?"").

Has been working solidly for the couple of months I've had it so far. Great computer for school its fast and powerful with lots of storage.,0
"Bought: 8/28/21Received: 9/2/213 months pass....Broke: 12/4/21Problem? Where to begin....Before the complete meltdown of this device, I encountered constant overheating. The ""feet"" of the laptop are mega small, and the fans are on the bottom, so the fans are blocked at all times.... This caused a ton of over heating, even when doing basic things like Facebook, email, or typing up reports.... I can't imagine what would happen if you tried to actually game on it!Then the day came where I started it up, it worked for a solid 10 minutes, then the screen went black. I tried shutting it down, restarting it, connecting it to a different screen.... nothing worked. I tried contacting Amazon, but it was passed the return policy date, so I had to contact Razer.A company by gamers for gamers, right?I contacted them immediately on 12/4/21. I was asked for details, like purchase date, location, device info, all the relevant stuff.... I sent it on the same day. Then they wanted video of the problem, and photos that the device wasn't physically broken. Sent! Finally, the time came where they asked me to send my product in. I waited for them to tell me what was wrong. 20 days later, 12/24/21, they send me a quote, on a product that's under warranty, with zero explanation!After being bounced around for a month, they want to charge me $356.49 to fix the motherboard. Why wont they cover it? They claim I dropped it and that there's damage. Good thing I have those photos and videos that they asked for!$356.49 in addition to the original $1278. This laptop is not worth that. It is poor quality, over heats, and broke in 3 months. The RAZER support team is also less than stellar to work with. All in all..... wish I paid a little extra for an ASUS.....",1
"I was hoping to get an advanced for a while, as I like the slimmer look, vapor chamber cooling, eight cores and ability to charge via USB-C. Only thing, they are much more pricey than the chunky base models. Amazon Warehouse had an ""acceptable"" condition one, which means there may have been some scratches etc. Other than the look, which I was fine with having ordered a skin regardless, the laptop works perfectly.Quiet and cool when casual use (like office and college work), yes it gets hot and audible when gaming or editing, but in an all metal body this slim, it really is to be expected. Battery life is nothing fantastic, but fine for a medium coffeeshop stay or a flight wait. This is not an Ultrabook after all, with a GPU and a big screen. The keyboard lighting is brighter on the advanced model too. Oh and upgrading the computer is super easy.To sum, give Amazon Warehouse deals ago, as you can get a great product, with 90 warranty / returns and save some cash. Best purchase I have made in 2021.",0
Great for gaming.,1
"the colors are off, they all have a yellow stained tint, which is  frustrating considering the price, if you are a gamer that wants true color then this laptop is not for you or if you are a digital artist then stay away from this laptop.

"I love this laptop, the build wuality is amazing ,the track pad, and the screen are godsends, but the battery life is awful even when you arent gaming, and when gaming (or not) its just awfully loud and hot at all times. Seems like more of a hassle than a laptop should be.",1

"I'm a graphic designer and video editor, so I wanted a laptop that could handle having 5 Adobe programs open without pooping out, and that, unlike Mac, could be upgraded and also run games. This was an investment purchase I hoped to use for a long time.I'm still in the over-cautious phase of the big purchase and have only used the laptop at a desk and sitting upright, I've been cautious about not over-charging even though it claims to have a system that protects from over-charging, and kept the charging cable untangled and didn't really move it while plugged in. So color me surprised when in just under a month, the battery stopped charging and the laptop died as soon as it was unplugged.After some googling and forums I initially brushed off as 1/10000 chances when I was researching laptops, this battery issue has been a problem since 2015 that they still haven't solved. Customer service troubleshot the problem to be the charging port., Don't bother emailing them because they say to wait three days or more for a response over email. Instead, I used their chat feature in customer service and the guy was nice enough and walked me through some troubleshooting to figure out the problem that I had to describe like three times. He assumed I just had a 100W USB-C cable on hand to use as a secondary charging device, something not included with the laptop, which also didn't work. And now I have to send out a laptop I bought LESS THAN A MONTH AGO for repair that could take 2 weeks, half the time I've had the laptop.UPDATE:The customer service team is clearly run out of the USA, likely India. They have absolutely no skill or authority to talk about issues and use weird, confusing phrases, and never respond to questions. Iconic phrases such as:""the Battery that needs to be replaced is out of stock."", followed by an email the next day saying, ""We received an update from our Repair Team that the battery has been replenished."" Which then took three emails asking if that means the battery has been replaced or not, one of which contained a request for information on refunds because I did not want a laptop with the same broken battery. One of those emails even said 'Sorry for the confusion!' then proceeded to not clear up anything at all.When they did answer it, what I got was ""With regard to your query, by the time our team inspected your unit with faulty battery, we haven't had stocks for the battery parts yet. That was why, you were offered with the unit replacement instead. For some reason, our parts have been restocked,"" So, for some reason parts were restocked. And I was brushed off on my concerns. Any questions about returns were directed to their website, so clearly the customer support team has no authority to actually do anything or answer any questions.All of it is sprinkled in with a frustratingly upbeat ""Hope your day is as good as mine."" and ""Giving you excellent service is always a pleasure."" I'm having to pass up freelance work and not getting questions answered, so no, my day isn't going great and I'm not getting excellent service, but good luck finding someone at Razer to express that too because the customer service team doesn't even read emails.",1
" You pay for aesthetics, build, bragging rights and obviously performance.Saw a bunch of negative reviews about quality issues but my unit is fine.Imported all the way to India and it survived because packaging was nice.And it looks much better than pictures.",1

Had to search up how to resolve this and apparently you can't, and the speakers are just terrible, but then again its made for gaming not for the sound. Otherwise the laptop is amazing.

"As a gaming laptop, this system is one of the best i have ever used. It runs smoothly, and beautifully.However, after owning this laptop for about 6 months, it is entirely unusable.

Even going so far as to say that it would be ""unfair to those who bought RazerCare"" to cover it under warranty.There is literally no reason it needs to be this fancy 3 pin design with the smaller pins being so flimsy.

"Bought 2 of the 2080/1TB version and we are really enjoying them. I would think most people would know this, but this is a very thin and powerful laptop, so it is going to have high thermals, I would recommend using a laptop cooler as a stand for it. The build quality is great, the attention to details like the keyboards and software are great. I am really struggling to try to find something negative to say about this laptop. Maybe the price but I feel like if you are in the market for a clean/quality gaming laptop (or hard-working work laptop) with an aluminum finish, you are looking at this price tag already. Razer I think really nailed it with this laptop.",1

Good,1
Has been working solidly for the couple of months I've had it so far. Great computer for school its fast and powerful with lots of storage.,1
"An excellent little laptop, but I got two small defects in a row. that's simply not acceptable when I'm paying this much money. Overall, everything is pretty good, and the internals are very powerful. It's a really nice machine. Just don't buy it from here.",1
"Overall great gaming laptop. Bought it as a mobile workstation with gaming potential (in that order). So far is blasting fast for everyday use and every game i've tried runs +30 FPS on the best settings. I've haven't been able to reach 300 FPS in any game so the 300Hz display is a bit of an overkill.The built quality is amazing, a bit sharp on the edges (I was used to a macbook) and feels sturdy.PROS:- It is a beast hiding on a very sober design. Besides the green logo on the back of the display, you wouldn't know its a gaming laptop, which is great if you plan using it on a formal workplace (which is my case).- The RGB keyboard is a great addition if you take the time to really configure the different lightning options for each app.CONS:- It gets HOT. I cannot use it on the bed/lap while playing any casual game (the temperature its ok/mildly unconfortable for browsing the internet though).- The proprietary charger port seems to be designed to be a tight fit which makes you feel you are scratching the aluminum (sometimes you are).- Speakers are bad, super bad. I didn't expect them to sound good, but they are not useful for anything else but conferencing.- Expensive, here you are paying for a simplistic gaming design, premium materials and awesome thermal performance on a thin laptop.Semi-CON:- The battery life is somewhere around 3 hours. Not bad for a gaming laptop, but for a mobile workstation means you will need to carry a charger wherever you go. I solved it by using a 100W USB C charger for moving around instead of the bulky 230W original charger, but you  wont be able to achieve peak performance this way.",1
"Razer delivered damaged product, and they blamed it on me after second return for overheating and trackpad quitting. Support ignores emails. They expected me to pay over $1,600 to repair a device that never worked right. After first repair, they returned damaged device with messed up screen and damaged case. On second return, they alleged always had water damage and would not repair even though all damage was by them. I barely used device and now it’s useless if they ever even return it. Battery life was abysmal and keyboard design was poor.",1
" i love this laptop !!! right now, i could only afford to get a gaming laptop that works alongside school, or i could get a full on PC and not have a laptop for school. its a great machine ! im a streamer, and it consistently pumps out 60fps streams which is really nice. its not super loud so if i want to cool it down on stream i can max out the fans and not have it be super annoying to listen to. the thing about this laptop though is that its SUPER hot. i usually stream minecraft and have discord, streamlabs, spotify, and vtube studio all on at the same time, and it gets quite hot. like, if my food was that hot i’d probably have to blow on it before eating it. its super noticeable when you press down on the keys and you feel it on your fingertips, and its kind of uncomfortable. despite all that, i can get a solid 120fps on every game that i play with no issues. personally, upgrading from an actual potato to this was a legendary change.so to summarize ,,pros : gaming is very smooth ! i love the design and the razed synapse is easy to work around. the rgb on the keyboard is nice looking and pressing on the keys feels nice. the screen is nice and bright and i dont lag whenever i stream and play games at the same time. its easily my favorite laptop ! its light, really aesthetically pleasing, and works just the way i want it tocons: the speakers suck. its really funny to me because on my old potato the speakers are leaps and bounds better than these. not that i use them often, but whenever i want to take a break from my headphones these speakers are not it. the battery doesnt last too long when off the charger, but i havent ran that many tests so it could probably stay on longer if i changed around a few settings to take the computers focus off of performance. it gets REALLY hot. an ice cube could melt pretty fast on the surface of it if i were playing genshin impact on high settings, medium if im streaming and listening to music.overall, i like this laptop because its a lot better than my old one. if i were you, i’d probably sit tight and save up some more money to get the advanced model for that cooling system, or look for something else if you want a cooler laptop. honestly, i think it cools on pretty quickly if you close the game and wait for a minute with the fans maxed, but im pretty lenient when it comes to machines. anyways, i hope this helped !",0

"Bought in October 2020, noticed in November 2021 that the unit wouldn’t charge the battery and the laptop won’t stay on when unplugged. Razer wasn’t willing to help me out, wanted me to ship the laptop back to them and PREPAY a $99 fee to “diagnose” what is a common & known defect with these laptops and then pay once the repairs are made. I’m barely one month out of warranty and no favors from Razer to help support their “premium” product.I’m selling the laptop and moving on to a different manufacturer.",1
"So I bought this towards the end of last year and let me tell you: This runs a LOT better than my old PC. I bought it initially so I could bring it with me to petsittings (I house sit dogs for a living) and I have been able to start my portfolio in voice acting as a result! If you want a good PC for gaming and to re-discover old hobbies you forgot you loved, BUY THIS GAMING DESKTOP! It is also super easy to buy an SSD card for more memory and the like on here if you'd like. If I had one complaint, it is simply that it comes without an ethernet port, but this is easy to remedy, I assure you!",0
"This product arrived and what exactly what I ordered and expected. No dead pixels. No issues with my battery charger. I'm mostly reviewing this product because I noticed a lot of negative reviews. I gave it the standard windows updates and that took care of some start up issues. Razer synapse is the only bloatware that comes pre-installed. I needed it though to edit the lighting configuration. Everything I have experienced with this laptop has met or exceeded my expectations. Gaming on warzone, league, and overwatch have been superb.",1
"The laptop is just great. Fells like a hight quality build. Screen has a beautiful display. RGB Chroma makes it look cool. Most importantly it runs most games out there at 1920 x 1080 resolution on ultra high settings with no noticeable FPS drops. Yes it does get hot when running games at those settings but if you play it in an A/C cooled room, connected to a TV via HDMI, it doesnt get as hot. And its How I always used the laptopThat is also why my review is a 2 Star rating. In less than one year the HDMI port on my laptop stopped working. The computer does detect the TV and lets me assign a resolution for it but theres no display on my TV. Its funny that one should pay over $2000 on a computer for it to start breaking apart in less than a year. After trying litterally every troubleshooting step I could find and contacting Razer they decided I should send the computer for repair. And as of now Im waiting for them to reply to me. Havent heard from them since before yesterday.I will update the review as the story develops. But as of now I could not justify their ultra expensive release prices for their products if they are not even going to outlast the manufacturers warranty.Update 1: Razer will sell their products to Puerto Rico customers. Even on their webise they will ship them to Puerto Rico. Even Best Buy stores in the island sell Razer products. But in case of a warranty claim. If the product needs to be sent for repairs/replacement, it has to be sent first to an address in the USA so it can then be sent to Razer.This might also apply to any US territory. So, dear purchaser please consider it seriously before purchasing from Razer. Specially if you live in a US territory like Puerto Rico.Update 2: It turns out that Razer does offer direct warranty support to Puerto Rico. Seems like some CSR were misinformed. In the end I was able to send the faulty laptop to razer and they sent if back repaired. Had to wait about a week which ia not that bad.Im giving it a 3 star review because while my problem was resolved is the 1st time I had a new laptop go bad on me in less that a year, that and the misinformation on behalf of customer service.Overall Razer has cool looking products but theres always a chance of buying something that might not last. If its under warranty then youre covered.",1

I haven't had any issues yet with the laptop. The only things that have bothered me so far is the loudness from the fan and when I'm typing my right hand tends to touch the touchpad and it messes up my typing. But that's easily fixed by disabling it when a mouse is plugged in.I've been using it for work and gaming and I haven't been disappointed yet.,1
Love this gaming laptop. The battery life is awesome. Just make sure you get a good fan for this laptop as it can get pretty hot.,1

The battery overheats of using it for an hour or so. Not a big deal as it can be solved by buying a cooling pad. Just not convenient. Great for gaming and very easy to upgrade any SSD cards.,0
"In terms of this machine's performance in running daily tasks or playing games at high settings, I didn't have any issues. However, there are two issues that made it almost exceedingly annoying to use at times:The first has to do with the heat levels on the palm rest. While not much of an issue while browsing the internet or other basic tasks, if you happen to be gaming or doing anything that demands more power, the palm rest area can get hot enough to be very uncomfortable and even slightly painful.The second issue is the palm rejection on the touchpad. The touchpad is nice and large and is easy to use, but even on the lowest sensitivity settings, you will frequently find as you are typing on a word document that your cursor randomly moves up several lines or a paragraph is deleted because the touchpad registered the slightest whiff of your palm as you were typing.One minor issue that is probably obvious to anyone purchasing this device is that it is a fingerprint magnet. If that bothers you, just be prepared to be cleaning it a lot.",1
Great product! No other laptop better than this for the price ritgh now,1
"This is exactly what you think it is. A very well designed powerful gaming laptop. The chassis looks and feels awesome, gaming on desktop, steam, stadia is incredible and Razer technical support is top notch. Added bonus is having this laptop when everyone else at the coffee shop has a Mac.",1
"So I bought this towards the end of last year and let me tell you: This runs a LOT better than my old PC. I bought it initially so I could bring it with me to petsittings (I house sit dogs for a living) and I have been able to start my portfolio in voice acting as a result! If you want a good PC for gaming and to re-discover old hobbies you forgot you loved, BUY THIS GAMING DESKTOP! It is also super easy to buy an SSD card for more memory and the like on here if you'd like. If I had one complaint, it is simply that it comes without an ethernet port, but this is easy to remedy, I assure you!",1
"I'm a graphic designer and video editor, so I wanted a laptop that could handle having 5 Adobe programs open without pooping out, and that, unlike Mac, could be upgraded and also run games. This was an investment purchase I hoped to use for a long time.I'm still in the over-cautious phase of the big purchase and have only used the laptop at a desk and sitting upright, I've been cautious about not over-charging even though it claims to have a system that protects from over-charging, and kept the charging cable untangled and didn't really move it while plugged in. So color me surprised when in just under a month, the battery stopped charging and the laptop died as soon as it was unplugged.After some googling and forums I initially brushed off as 1/10000 chances when I was researching laptops, this battery issue has been a problem since 2015 that they still haven't solved. Customer service troubleshot the problem to be the charging port., Don't bother emailing them because they say to wait three days or more for a response over email. Instead, I used their chat feature in customer service and the guy was nice enough and walked me through some troubleshooting to figure out the problem that I had to describe like three times. He assumed I just had a 100W USB-C cable on hand to use as a secondary charging device, something not included with the laptop, which also didn't work. And now I have to send out a laptop I bought LESS THAN A MONTH AGO for repair that could take 2 weeks, half the time I've had the laptop.UPDATE:The customer service team is clearly run out of the USA, likely India. They have absolutely no skill or authority to talk about issues and use weird, confusing phrases, and never respond to questions. Iconic phrases such as:""the Battery that needs to be replaced is out of stock."", followed by an email the next day saying, ""We received an update from our Repair Team that the battery has been replenished."" Which then took three emails asking if that means the battery has been replaced or not, one of which contained a request for information on refunds because I did not want a laptop with the same broken battery. One of those emails even said 'Sorry for the confusion!' then proceeded to not clear up anything at all.When they did answer it, what I got was ""With regard to your query, by the time our team inspected your unit with faulty battery, we haven't had stocks for the battery parts yet. That was why, you were offered with the unit replacement instead. For some reason, our parts have been restocked,"" So, for some reason parts were restocked. And I was brushed off on my concerns. Any questions about returns were directed to their website, so clearly the customer support team has no authority to actually do anything or answer any questions.All of it is sprinkled in with a frustratingly upbeat ""Hope your day is as good as mine."" and ""Giving you excellent service is always a pleasure."" I'm having to pass up freelance work and not getting questions answered, so no, my day isn't going great and I'm not getting excellent service, but good luck finding someone at Razer to express that too because the customer service team doesn't even read emails.",1
"It is CHEAP for a good reason.1) it uses the generic 180w power adapter with the round plug instead of razer’s proprietary square plug in higher watt models2) probably just me, but the keyboard was mushy, the trackpad wobbled, and the backlight screen was bleeding. QC is bad.3) the motherboard layout is different from ALL reviews and videos you will see on the internet. It uses a 60.8wh battery as oppose to 65wh batteries from the others.4) Latest Razer Blade models use WiFi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2; the cheap 1660ti/120hz model uses WiFi 5 and Bluetooth 5.1. During my test, I get latency issues.You may purchase at your own risk, but be prepared to RMA it. I can’t say that it’s better or worse than it’s relatives,  but it’s definitely built differently than the rest of them. It's a premium laptop, but less premium than the rest of Razer's offering.",1
Some microphones that only use the headphones port can make people sound really bad. It only take 30-40 min to get really hot. It can run most games though.,1
"I like it when used with a keyboard and mouse on a desk for gaming. If you also wish to use this as a laptop, forget it. The edges of this laptop are sharp and frequently causes cuts. The trackpad is too big and unusable because of sharp edges, with terrible heating issues. I understand that gaming laptops tend to overheat a lot in, however, I was doing some basic surfing for a few hours coupled with some light online boardgames for 4 hours, and my battery didnt last the time, and overheated to the point where placing it on a bed or lap is a health hazard. The trackpad also gets pretty hot. My last laptop was a ThinkPad that had for 6 years with better battery life, came with half the price and barely heated so much for similar usage. While Im enjoying the display and quality specs, I do not always use this for gaming. Choose wisely.",1
"I am sure you’ve watched enough YouTube reviews on this unit. Coming from a 2017 Acer Predator 17 with 7700 and 1070M, I just want to say that it has much more power BUT it also heats up significantly fast. Nice little power plant for creativity and gaming for sure.",1
Great laptop very fast not a gamer but an engineering student and works very well for all my school programs including auto deck,1
"This laptop is amazing. From the looks to how it performs. The keyboard doesn’t travel as deep when you push the keys compared to other laptops I have used. However they feel nice to type on. Also I really like the color profiles in synapse. I’m getting great battery life with power saving settings. I’m getting around 5 -6 hours. When I’m plugged into the wall and I have the fans all the way up and the cpu and gpu are on high. I was getting around 130-150 FPS in death stranding,  With the settings all the way up in the game. It looked amazing and performed great. Overall, I’m happy I got this laptop.",0
"In terms of what I like... The quality feel, the performance, the fact this model includes Windows Hello facial recognition camera, and the lack of tons of junk pre-installed. This thing performs like a champ for what I'm using it to do.In terms of what I dislike... not much. Battery isn't as good as a less performant device, but that's obvious considering it's a high powered gaming laptop. No, what I dislike most is the custom power adapter connector instead of a more common connector like what Dell, HP, and others use. This isn't a problem for the one that comes with the laptop, but if you're like me and want to order extras or need to replace it, they're very expensive.",1
"Hello all! I hope my review can be helpful to someone out there. I purchased the 2070 max q advance model on prime day. After about 6 days I started jumping up and down as the kid in me was so excited to get a best of a computer. This was going to be a upgrade as I have been rocking a old 2009 mac pro and definitely was time to upgrade. Ups gave me the package and I just could not help my sled to get it open as soon as I possibly can! Only problem was that I received the base model 2060 max p. That a 1k laptop vs the 2k laptop I bought. I was very disappointed, this was my first major computer purchase and my first major amazon purchase. I hope amazon can get me set up but I don't have my fingers crossed. After this I will not be making a major purchase with amazon. When you spend 2k for something you should receive what you purchased not something that is more then half the price",1
"Great laptop for price, and CAN game on but i dont plan on being a hardcore gamer on this laptop, it definitely gets warm and loud when you push it. Im not a fan of the huge touchpad and not having a number pad but again its a great laptop for regular use that can be gamed on",1
"I received this laptop and I immediately noticed that the sound quality is awful. The remote control of an old Wii has equivalent sound. I have previous experience with a Razer Blade 15 (2016 Model) and the sound was great. I checked online if others have this problem and it seems like very few people seem to have an issue with the sound. I checked to see if it might be a driver issue or whether other drivers could help improve the sound, but none of the solutions worked.To me it seems like the speakers I have received are broken, which shows that Razer has a quality control issue. If that is the case then I can no longer recommend anybody purchase any of their products until this issue is resolved.",1
Of course 2 months after I buy it the razer 15 3080 comes out. Still an amazing laptop. It gets loud.,1
Need more ssd,1
I switched from a Macbook Pro to this Razer Blade. I have loved it so far! Razer has done a fantastic job on this and the laptop is very good to use!,0
Great laptop. Performs exceptionally well. Gets hot quite fast so you will want a cooling pad. Battery life is ok depending on how you use it.,0
"I love it. It's an amazing computer, with amazing features, and it works great! I have no problems with it, ad I would suggests this Gaming Laptop to others!",0
Be careful of number keys. Mine looked normal except numbers were unshifted and special character was shifted but the typing showed the reverse. I couldn't enter a password because of this.,1
The battery overheats of using it for an hour or so. Not a big deal as it can be solved by buying a cooling pad. Just not convenient. Great for gaming and very easy to upgrade any SSD cards.,1
"Took a gamble and bought ""Used - Very Good"" and the condition was basically perfect.Been using for 4 months and so far only had a few ""issues"" that were resolved (by me).1. Heard electric whine coming from laptop. Was concerned at first but noticed my other laptops also do it... seems normal for laptops.2. Games were suddenly very sluggish with huge fps drops. I just had to update the GPU drivers and it was fixed. (I didnt think to do this right away). Mainly play csgo and easily run at 300fps. Sometimes play apex and have no issues except it cant run apex at 150fps+.3. Speaking of Apex... the laptop gets VERY hot for intense games. I plug external monitor+mouse+keyboard so its not a big issue but it WILL heat up your room. The room temperature increase is noticeable. I dont think it's feasible to play on the laptop keyboard when playing something like Apex since the laptop gets too hot. My palms get sweaty and overall not a pleasant experience. The vapor cooling seems to work pretty well though... even when gaming for 10hours+ at high temps I dont get performance drops which is amazing imo. I considered getting a fan that sits under the laptop but it doesnt seem necessary. We'll see how it holds up over time.4. One day, bluetooth stopped working entirely. It just disappeared... even from Device Manager. I googled the issue and a BIOS reset fixed it.PROS:Build quality feels great. Impressed by it. Almost at mbp level.Great performance. I've played csgo, apex, gtav, mordhau, and valorant all with no issues.Screen looks pretty good. Not mbp level but better than average laptop screen imo. I'd imagine the 4k 60hz looks even better. (higher refresh rates monitors almost always look worse than lower rate picture-focused monitors)Does not come with a bunch of bloatware. (i hate bloatware w a passion)CONS:The laptop keyboard is HORRIBLE. Travel distance is so low it's annoying to use.You must install their proprietary razer software to customize the keyboard lighting.Gets VERY hot.Brand doesnt seem to have a good reputation for longevity so I do worry that it will randomly die on me one day.Logo on the lid is very ugly in my opinion.Wish it had one more usb c port.Overall, it's an extremely difficult task to compete with Apple and I'm happy that Razer put effort into creating a high end product that feels fairly polished. Four months in and I'm pleased with my purchase.Some misc thoughts... I dont think it was necessary for the screen to go up to 300hz... 240 is good enough imo... Would be nice if, for future versions, they got rid of the huge charger and made it usb c charge. Would be nice if I could buy a version with no webcam and they got rid of the top bezel.",1
"Every time I use this the cursor will jump to areas on the screen that I did not intend or keys that I did not press will press on their own. I can't use it as a laptop at all as a result. For its size it has great power, but overall it misses the mark on very basic functionality. When I asked customer service for an exchange at the discounted price I bought it at, they wouldn't do it. Will not be buying a Razer product ever again.",1
"Absolutely, bar none, the best laptop for Windows 10 on the market. I've owned MacBooks, high end dorky space ship looking laptops by other big names, and so on... this my friends, is the best , sleekest, ultra laptop one can buy. Very happy .... no bloatware, simple, sleep, awesome finish, material and marksmanship ... get yours!",1

"Living on a sailboat I've had to give up desktop pc's for laptops. I've had many over the years, usually top of the line beefy monsters. They were cumbersome and I always looked like ""that guy"" at work. After an unfortunate motorcycle accident that destroyed my 17"" Clevo (6 core I7 and full 2070) I started looking for something that could not only game, but was also portable and not so flashy at work (The unicorn). I was extremely nervous about the thermals, razer doesn't have a good reputation in that department. But to my surprise I haven't seen temps above 88c on the cpu. This is while playing games like Star Citizen, Arma 3, etc. Although its only been a few weeks of ownership, I couldn't be happier with this slim monster. The battery life is around 5 hours and gets me through a work day no problem (google sheets, scheduling and fleet tracking). PD charging is also extremely convenient if you're tight on space, but honestly the power brick is super small already. Only time will tell for longevity. The fingerprints are horrible, I'll be buying a debrand skin to not only protect from scratches but also my oily ass hands. My only real gripe is having only one storage drive slot, I really would have like 2x M.2's for raid 0 but that's just me being picky.",0

"I bought 2 of these for myself and my partner so we could play some games together. one was New and the other was Used - Very Good.The ""Very Good"" laptop was shipped in a box 20 times it's size with almost no packaging material what so ever, it was twisted and bent so it didn't sit flush with a flat surface anymore and wobbled like a table with a short leg. It was also covered in glue and stains, there was also no charger included.The second laptop, the ""New"" one came packaged fine in it's razer box, but the screen constantly goes black with static.  It does it at random times like in games or just browsing the web.Definitely don't plan on buying another Razer, and never testing my luck with a used laptop from Amazon again.",1
"Bought from Amazon directly,Came out of the box, like new.",1

"This product arrived and what exactly what I ordered and expected. No dead pixels. No issues with my battery charger. I'm mostly reviewing this product because I noticed a lot of negative reviews. I gave it the standard windows updates and that took care of some start up issues. Razer synapse is the only bloatware that comes pre-installed. I needed it though to edit the lighting configuration. Everything I have experienced with this laptop has met or exceeded my expectations. Gaming on warzone, league, and overwatch have been superb.",1
"Love that this is sturdy, light weight and aluminum metal covered and I don't think I'll have broken hinges in a year or two like my last two plastic gaming laptops.  That was my biggest concern in looking for a gaming laptop I could use to game a little but mostly to quickly photo edit and use photo shop when on the road.  It is extremely fast, out does my desktop and is now out of 4 pc's the one I use.  It's so quick I can't handle waiting on the others. Last years graphics is fine for the saving I garnered.  I'm a firm believer in I'd still be happy with my last years pc this year.  I easily installed a 2 TB m2 hard drive in the extra slot (love it has an empty slot for that) and the 16 GB ram seems to run my photo editing with fine speed and my older games.  This does not have thunderbolt to connect a display through the C port but has two type C ports that I use to connect all peripherals and then just use the hdmi to connect one monitor and use the laptop screen as a second so don't purchase a C type universal docking station to connect displays, display put through won't work on this 2020 model, i believe it has been updated by razer to work on the 2021 models.  Very very happy with this purchase for my needs.  Oh i thought I would miss the number bad, especially when photo editing but i've adapted to that quickly and do not miss it.",0
"UPDATE:I returned this and other other Razer laptops I ordered. Absolutely unusable trackpads. No palm detection whatsoever and completely impossible to adjust any Windows settings, find any specific drivers, or make any registry entries to fix it. Nonstop battles with the mouse jumping all over the screen at the slightest touch from the heel of my hand, while at the same time often ignoring very solid taps. Others complained about this online and the general consensus is that Razer support is apathetic and unresponsive. This experiment with Razer brand is over.====================The closest thing I have found to the excellent build quality of a MacBook Pro. Very solid an inflexible unibody construction and very high end components.However, it is clear that Razor has an engineering staff of nine geniuses and one idiot. In an incredibly boneheaded and unjustifiable move, they have reversed the labeling on the keys. For some asinine reason that serves no purpose other than to make your life miserable, they decided to place the symbols BELOW the numbers instead of above. And all the keys with dual characters (like colon and semicolon) are also backwards from every other keyboard on the planet. Insanity.Everybody's brain is wired to shift UP to the symbols. Not shift DOWN to them. So typing passwords with symbols is now a serious pain. Looking for the period or equal sign or semicolon? I promise you that your eyes will go right to the bottom of the key, and then won't find it. No human being, touch typist or not, recalls whether to shift for the square or curly bracket. You will look, you will see the backwards layout, and then you will type the wrong one. Again, completely idiotic move without the slightest benefit. I still may end up returning it before the return window expires.The only other serious complaint is over the touchpad. I fight it all day long. It alternately ignores very definite taps, and then responds to the slightest of all touches from the heel of my hand. This causes the cursor to randomly jump elsewhere on the screen or, as has happened TWICE while writing this, selecting all text in the text field so that your next keystroke overwrites all of it. My MacBook Pro touchpad was always flawless. No amount of adjustment in the Windows settings ends these problems.All said, an stupidity aside, the components and build quality are excellent. This truly is a desktop replacement when it comes to power and graphics performance. Just wish they would fire that one engineer.",0

"One of the best laptops, but the software and the speakers aren't that good. Got it on prime day for $1000 and was very happy with it. When restarting, synapse puts the fan speed on manual. Had to search up how to resolve this and apparently you can't, and the speakers are just terrible, but then again its made for gaming not for the sound. Otherwise the laptop is amazing. Great performance, and great battery life. Can run most games on high settings with no lag. Great laptop would recommend.",1
only thing I dont like it dose put out a lot of heat.  Over all a great computor,1
"The performance balance is amazing, for such a powerhouse machine this laptop can manage with all kind of recent games in high/ultra settings with excellent FPS in a amazing 300hz display. I recommend to go with the Nvidia RTX 2070 Super Q Max, the performance is absolute and the higher RTX 2080 doesn't  make much difference.",0
"If you're worried about the hardware being outdated, do not be. Dying light 2 maxed to the limit connected to a monitor averages 65fps with drops to 50 in high activity sequences. I usually get 100-130 fps on all low settings. Rainbow 6 on Vulkan averaged 250fps. Both connected to a monitor-bypassing intel graphics. If you play on the display that is on the laptop, you will see a 10-20fps drop at higher fps. However, the display is still great, but 300hz is a gimic, you'll never see anything higher than 240 on a consistent basis. If you're wondering, you cannot play Minecraft RTX on this machine, it didn't give me the option no matter how hard I tried. COD Warzone multi ran at around 120 at low. The laptop has great build quality. But, the keyboard, infuriates me. The keyboard experience is horrendus for typing at high speeds/touch typing. The Dell G5 and Asus zephryus are vastly better for typing although the razer has the better performance of the three. You should expect 2-3 hours of battery life with medium activity such as a few browser tabs. Cooling isn't the greatest but it's passable. GPU never went above 80c on high gaming loads.Tl;dr: it's great in every way, except the keyboard, the keyboard is trash.",1
"Pros: The laptop itself is solid, great specs, good screen, well put together inside of an aluminum shell. IT is somewhat lightweight compared to others in the same class. It does offer charge from USB-C. It comes with a 1 year limited warranty.Cons: Technical support is lackluster. There is a large area of distrust, a heavy reliance on providing video proof. Support is slow responding. Hope that you do not have to do an RMA. Additionally, RazerCare, the extended warranty is not available from third party resellers after initial purchase.Charging: While it can do a trickle charge from USB-C at 100w, it is insufficient to charge while the laptop is under load. To adequately charge, you will need to use the 230w AC Adapter. This provides challenges as a docking station, even from Razer, provides insufficient power for this laptop.Quality issues: The AC Adapter went out after less than 3.5 months of use. Contact support and they want a video of it not working so that they can start the RMA process. As a heads-up that means that you send in your part, once they receive it, they repair or replace and then you will get a return. If they receive it. If they don't you get nothing.Intangibles: Windows had display issues from day 1, where the Optimus driver did not work with the laptop monitor. This required a bypass by using an external monitor. Once into Windows you can either use the Synapse software or simply go into the BIOS to adjust it to using the dedicated GPU.  This works fine, but will reduce battery life to a pedestrian 1-1.5 hours if you do more than light web browsing. If you want a gaming machine, this is not a deal breaker. If you are wanting something transitioning between gaming and other stuff, this might present serious issues.",1
"excelente por donde se lo mire. En la descripción está mal porque viene con 16gb de ram, no 8gb. Después el producto cumple con todo, cerca de 1 mes que la tengo y ningún problema. Excelente.",0
"I have had this for around a month now. While the computer is able to manage anything I've wanted to do, I wanted to point out two things. One, oddly enough I had to reinstall the battery device as it was telling me right out of the box that it wasn't getting a sufficient charge. A quick fix with some nice people on the Razer forums telling me what to do. The second issue i've had with this computer is that it gets really really hot when I am playing a game. I even have a fan on underneath it but the keyboard, and near the monitor is really hot to the touch, sometimes if i've only been playing 30 minutes. I never experienced any of that with my last gaming laptop. Otherwise I am really happy with the purchase, so far.",1
"The fan runs at high speed continuously while operating this PoS laptop and it is LOUD. Added bonus is that because the fan runs at high speed and constantly, you can not use this PoS as a laptop; it needs to be plugged in because the high speed, loud fan sucks the battery to nothing in no time at all. Keep looking, there are better options out there, or just buy a desktop and solve both problems (loud fan killing any hope for battery life).",1
"The laptop is wonderful. I needed this mostly to run AcrGIS software and do a little bit of gaming on the side. It has done well for both. The SSD memory size is small, but I knew that going in and the laptop seems like it's made it fairly easy to add more SSD storage. I am looking forward to adding at least 1 TB in the near future.The only unfortunate thing is the power adapter has stopped functioning less than 3 months into me buying/using the laptop. I contacted the sellers and they referred me to Razer to see about their warranty. Razer seems like they provide a lot more support for the products bought on their site and not as much outside of their site. You have to buy it from an approved seller which can be tricky to do on Amazon. My seller was not official. However? I did receive help after a lot of back and forth between Razer and the amazon seller. The Amazon sellers ended up getting a replacement for me. It was a very lengthy process, but it was resolved and I'm very grateful for their effort in getting that fixed for me.Overall, the Razer Blade 15 is a great laptop, but it's definitely worth considering where you buy it in case situations like mine occur. Razer may help out when you buy it from a different seller but it is a lengthy process. I do appreciate the sellers helping out though.",1

"An excellent little laptop, but I got two small defects in a row. that's simply not acceptable when I'm paying this much money. Overall, everything is pretty good, and the internals are very powerful. It's a really nice machine. Just don't buy it from here.",1
"I bought this for working remote looking at and downloading photographs basically. Has been working great! Battery life is as I'd expect, images and spotted are perfect for what I needed",1
"Payed USD1099 for this Razer base model. At that price this is a steal, at USD 1199 is an excellent purchage but at the original price of USD1599 not worth the money. The SSD included is really low performance. If you plan to really game with this laptop buy a new NVMe ssd storage.Amazing how BAD the sound of the speakers in this laptop, terrible terrible bad quality sound. Not sure why Razer use THX...",0
"Charging port prong broken inside of the port, discovered after I unboxed it… I didn’t even get to turn this Razor 15 on. This laptop also looks refurbished. There’s no protective adhesive stickers, the bottom half of the box isn’t sealed, it just unfolds right open. I have to say now that I don’t trust both the seller and Razer.I’ve tried to reach customer support through Amazon and after the wait message there was no one talking on the the line. I’m going to try again tomorrow. Hopefully I can update this message to a better one to see if anything gets resolved. I was supposed to DJ some sets and livestream some games and content with this laptop. Looks like those plans are canceled.",1
The battery life is really great for this laptop! It runs so smoothly and I am very happy with it overall. The RGB keyboard and glowing Razer symbol in the back are super cool features as well!,1
"Run away.  This is absolute garbage.Mine never left my desk and yet the motherboard has failed twice.Each time I have to jump through ridiculous hoops for their tech support to help.They make you upload a video, just in case you don't know what you're talking about.Then, when you send it to them, they wipe you're hard drive.  Which I understand, but it would be nice if I didn't have to reinstall every time my motherboard decides it's dead.When the laptop works, it's fantastic, but if it never works, it never gets to be anything but a paperweight.",1
"excelente por donde se lo mire. En la descripción está mal porque viene con 16gb de ram, no 8gb. Después el producto cumple con todo, cerca de 1 mes que la tengo y ningún problema. Excelente.",1
"Ordered the product and finally arrived to my address in the Philippines via a freight forwarder.The unit delivered to me works. Seeing as there's a lot of 1 star reviews, hoping there would be no defects or errors encounteredOnly complaint about the product is that it runs hot despite running basic tasks as mentioned in other reviews",0
"I do cooking streams, and this laptop gets the job done! I have not ran any game play on it yet, but may in the future!",1
The laptop is very unique and different than any other laptops I've ever had I would give an A+ to the design. The laptop version I got had a small hard drive which would definitely need upgraded one game takes up almost the whole hard drive or at least 1/3. The laptop also seems to play every game pretty well I do not get into the most high-tech games but I do play the total war Series games and it runs perfect for all those except when it overheats. It seems to overheat very quickly when you start playing a game and this causes the computer itself to freeze crash and shut itself off. And if it doesn't do all that the game usually lags uncontrollably until you give it a timeout and shut it down for a while to cool. The battery life does not last very long even if I'm just running a simple app while having it unplugged it drains fast. If I have it unplugged during a game I'm lucky to get 20 30 minutes out of it. It's quite a shame this is a very unique laptop and I really want to love it but there are issues.,1
"In terms of what I like... The quality feel, the performance, the fact this model includes Windows Hello facial recognition camera, and the lack of tons of junk pre-installed. This thing performs like a champ for what I'm using it to do.In terms of what I dislike... not much. Battery isn't as good as a less performant device, but that's obvious considering it's a high powered gaming laptop. No, what I dislike most is the custom power adapter connector instead of a more common connector like what Dell, HP, and others use. This isn't a problem for the one that comes with the laptop, but if you're like me and want to order extras or need to replace it, they're very expensive.",0
It a beast of a gaming marchine,1
"Absolutely, bar none, the best laptop for Windows 10 on the market. I've owned MacBooks, high end dorky space ship looking laptops by other big names, and so on... this my friends, is the best , sleekest, ultra laptop one can buy. Very happy .... no bloatware, simple, sleep, awesome finish, material and marksmanship ... get yours!",0
"I've had a lot of computers and laptops over the past 30 years. One thing that has gotten progressively worse (and annoying) is all the bloatware. Almost every manufacturer ads their own support aps, anti virus, market place, etc. All they do it slow it down and bug up the system.This is my first Razer and I'm never going back. They only ad 1 app and that's to program all the RGBs and tweak the system performance. It's a subtle app too.Combined with the great hardware they put in their systems, the build quality is what really sets it apart. I got mine for engineering work. Other brands add an ""enterprise tax"" to anything they say I'd for professional use or if it mentions CAD in the description.I run Fusion 360 on this with no issues. Renders like butter too.",0
"The laptop is wonderful. I needed this mostly to run AcrGIS software and do a little bit of gaming on the side. It has done well for both. The SSD memory size is small, but I knew that going in and the laptop seems like it's made it fairly easy to add more SSD storage. I am looking forward to adding at least 1 TB in the near future.The only unfortunate thing is the power adapter has stopped functioning less than 3 months into me buying/using the laptop. I contacted the sellers and they referred me to Razer to see about their warranty. Razer seems like they provide a lot more support for the products bought on their site and not as much outside of their site. You have to buy it from an approved seller which can be tricky to do on Amazon. My seller was not official. However? I did receive help after a lot of back and forth between Razer and the amazon seller. The Amazon sellers ended up getting a replacement for me. It was a very lengthy process, but it was resolved and I'm very grateful for their effort in getting that fixed for me.Overall, the Razer Blade 15 is a great laptop, but it's definitely worth considering where you buy it in case situations like mine occur. Razer may help out when you buy it from a different seller but it is a lengthy process. I do appreciate the sellers helping out though.",1
"works well.  battery life average, but worth the price",0
"Great laptop, especially at its price. Only complaints are that it runs so hot you need to be careful where you set it, and the keyboard is missing the home and end keys. I’d definitely buy it again if given the choice. The battery performs as advertised which is pretty decent considering what’s under the hood.",1
"Overall great gaming laptop. Bought it as a mobile workstation with gaming potential (in that order). So far is blasting fast for everyday use and every game i've tried runs +30 FPS on the best settings. I've haven't been able to reach 300 FPS in any game so the 300Hz display is a bit of an overkill.The built quality is amazing, a bit sharp on the edges (I was used to a macbook) and feels sturdy.PROS:- It is a beast hiding on a very sober design. Besides the green logo on the back of the display, you wouldn't know its a gaming laptop, which is great if you plan using it on a formal workplace (which is my case).- The RGB keyboard is a great addition if you take the time to really configure the different lightning options for each app.CONS:- It gets HOT. I cannot use it on the bed/lap while playing any casual game (the temperature its ok/mildly unconfortable for browsing the internet though).- The proprietary charger port seems to be designed to be a tight fit which makes you feel you are scratching the aluminum (sometimes you are).- Speakers are bad, super bad. I didn't expect them to sound good, but they are not useful for anything else but conferencing.- Expensive, here you are paying for a simplistic gaming design, premium materials and awesome thermal performance on a thin laptop.Semi-CON:- The battery life is somewhere around 3 hours. Not bad for a gaming laptop, but for a mobile workstation means you will need to carry a charger wherever you go. I solved it by using a 100W USB C charger for moving around instead of the bulky 230W original charger, but you  wont be able to achieve peak performance this way.",1
"Bought from Amazon directly,Came out of the box, like new.",1
It’s the stuff that dreams are made of.,1
"Bought 2 of the 2080/1TB version and we are really enjoying them. I would think most people would know this, but this is a very thin and powerful laptop, so it is going to have high thermals, I would recommend using a laptop cooler as a stand for it. The build quality is great, the attention to details like the keyboards and software are great. I am really struggling to try to find something negative to say about this laptop. Maybe the price but I feel like if you are in the market for a clean/quality gaming laptop (or hard-working work laptop) with an aluminum finish, you are looking at this price tag already. Razer I think really nailed it with this laptop.",0
"i bought this in prime day for $930, it was a bargain, the laptop is great the only issue as all gaming laptops is that it gets hot when gaming for long time and can affect the perfurmance",0
Great laptop. Performs exceptionally well. Gets hot quite fast so you will want a cooling pad. Battery life is ok depending on how you use it.,1
Works great for gaming cab run most games on ultra high settings without lag or for drops. However if planing on using laptop for gaming on hours just keep in mind it runs really hot and you may want to purcahse a laptop cooler with the laptop. The battery life is good hoever has an artist I wish it were a bit longer. Sleep mode turns the pc rgb keyboard and razor logo backight off.,1
"I am sure you’ve watched enough YouTube reviews on this unit. Coming from a 2017 Acer Predator 17 with 7700 and 1070M, I just want to say that it has much more power BUT it also heats up significantly fast. Nice little power plant for creativity and gaming for sure.",1
"I ordered this as a gift for my son on Prime Day in June 2021 -- at a Prime Day discounted price. It was supposedly shipped but a few days later, I got a notice that it was delayed and would not be delivered. (WHAT???) Of course, Amazon said they'd reship, but I could no longer get the Prime Day discount. But my son REALLY wanted it, so I went ahead at the regular price (even though my order details show I got it at the Prime Day price, but that's not how it actually worked out). My son loved this Razer laptop for a while, but a few months ago the keyboard quit working and then the whole thing died. It's still under warranty, but trying to get help from Razer is IMPOSSIBLE! After weeks of trying to get help from Razer, they finally provided a shipping label for us to return the laptop. They acknowledged receipt of the device two weeks ago, and we've heard nothing since. It's impossible to get any kind of updates from Razer on its status. This experience has given me serious heartburn toward both Amazon and Razer. Also, I have to wonder why the original product couldn't be delivered, and the one that was eventually delivered turns out to be defective.",1
Our gamer loved it,1
It a beast of a gaming marchine,1
I haven't had any issues yet with the laptop. The only things that have bothered me so far is the loudness from the fan and when I'm typing my right hand tends to touch the touchpad and it messes up my typing. But that's easily fixed by disabling it when a mouse is plugged in.I've been using it for work and gaming and I haven't been disappointed yet.,1
best gaming laptop company!!!,1
Got the razer laptop and I already fell in love with it.,1

"The performance balance is amazing, for such a powerhouse machine this laptop can manage with all kind of recent games in high/ultra settings with excellent FPS in a amazing 300hz display.

"Great laptop for price, and CAN game on but i dont plan on being a hardcore gamer on this laptop, it definitely gets warm and loud when you push it. Im not a fan of the huge touchpad and not having a number pad but again its a great laptop for regular use that can be gamed on",1
"works well.  battery life average, but worth the price",1
The keyboard is not a full size keyboard but razer has all the functionalities embedded in it. You could buy separate keyboard if you are not used to it. Other than these minute matters I don't have anything to say as Razer has and is living up to its name.,0

" i love this laptop !!! right now, i could only afford to get a gaming laptop that works alongside school, or i could get a full on PC and not have a laptop for school. its a great machine ! im a streamer, and it consistently pumps out 60fps streams which is really nice. its not super loud so if i want to cool it down on stream i can max out the fans and not have it be super annoying to listen to. the thing about this laptop though is that its SUPER hot. i usually stream minecraft and have discord, streamlabs, spotify, and vtube studio all on at the same time, and it gets quite hot. like, if my food was that hot i’d probably have to blow on it before eating it. its super noticeable when you press down on the keys and you feel it on your fingertips, and its kind of uncomfortable. despite all that, i can get a solid 120fps on every game that i play with no issues. personally, upgrading from an actual potato to this was a legendary change.so to summarize ,,pros : gaming is very smooth ! i love the design and the razed synapse is easy to work around. the rgb on the keyboard is nice looking and pressing on the keys feels nice. the screen is nice and bright and i dont lag whenever i stream and play games at the same time. its easily my favorite laptop ! its light, really aesthetically pleasing, and works just the way i want it tocons: the speakers suck. its really funny to me because on my old potato the speakers are leaps and bounds better than these. not that i use them often, but whenever i want to take a break from my headphones these speakers are not it. the battery doesnt last too long when off the charger, but i havent ran that many tests so it could probably stay on longer if i changed around a few settings to take the computers focus off of performance. it gets REALLY hot. an ice cube could melt pretty fast on the surface of it if i were playing genshin impact on high settings, medium if im streaming and listening to music.overall, i like this laptop because its a lot better than my old one. if i were you, i’d probably sit tight and save up some more money to get the advanced model for that cooling system, or look for something else if you want a cooler laptop. honestly, i think it cools on pretty quickly if you close the game and wait for a minute with the fans maxed, but im pretty lenient when it comes to machines. anyways, i hope this helped !",0

"We purchased this as an Amazon Prime day deal, and it said near the top of the page that this model was a touchscreen.  We even scrolled through the rest of the options and the ""Human Interface Input"" changed.  That being said, my daughter decided she could learn to live without the touchscreen, but was disappointed.  I am giving this 4 stars, because of false advertising, but may alter that after the laptop has been used more.  We just received the product, but wanted to mention the touchscreen issue.",1

"In terms of this machine's performance in running daily tasks or playing games at high settings, I didn't have any issues. However, there are two issues that made it almost exceedingly annoying to use at times:The first has to do with the heat levels on the palm rest. While not much of an issue while browsing the internet or other basic tasks, if you happen to be gaming or doing anything that demands more power, the palm rest area can get hot enough to be very uncomfortable and even slightly painful.The second issue is the palm rejection on the touchpad. The touchpad is nice and large and is easy to use, but even on the lowest sensitivity settings, you will frequently find as you are typing on a word document that your cursor randomly moves up several lines or a paragraph is deleted because the touchpad registered the slightest whiff of your palm as you were typing.One minor issue that is probably obvious to anyone purchasing this device is that it is a fingerprint magnet. If that bothers you, just be prepared to be cleaning it a lot.",1
"So disappointed.  This product listing on Amazon said the laptop had a touchscreen ... which turned out NOT to be true.  I went round and round with the company's customer service before we figured out ""why the touch screen wasn't working"".  At the end of the day, I invested over 12 hours of my valuable time trying to buy this laptop, only to send it back because it was not as advertised :( OK, so this sort of confusion abounds with online platforms.  But what really drove me mad was how uncaring and inattentive their customer service was :(",1
"UPDATE:I returned this and other other Razer laptops I ordered. Absolutely unusable trackpads. No palm detection whatsoever and completely impossible to adjust any Windows settings, find any specific drivers, or make any registry entries to fix it. Nonstop battles with the mouse jumping all over the screen at the slightest touch from the heel of my hand, while at the same time often ignoring very solid taps. Others complained about this online and the general consensus is that Razer support is apathetic and unresponsive. This experiment with Razer brand is over.====================The closest thing I have found to the excellent build quality of a MacBook Pro. Very solid an inflexible unibody construction and very high end components.However, it is clear that Razor has an engineering staff of nine geniuses and one idiot. In an incredibly boneheaded and unjustifiable move, they have reversed the labeling on the keys. For some asinine reason that serves no purpose other than to make your life miserable, they decided to place the symbols BELOW the numbers instead of above. And all the keys with dual characters (like colon and semicolon) are also backwards from every other keyboard on the planet. Insanity.Everybody's brain is wired to shift UP to the symbols. Not shift DOWN to them. So typing passwords with symbols is now a serious pain. Looking for the period or equal sign or semicolon? I promise you that your eyes will go right to the bottom of the key, and then won't find it. No human being, touch typist or not, recalls whether to shift for the square or curly bracket. You will look, you will see the backwards layout, and then you will type the wrong one. Again, completely idiotic move without the slightest benefit. I still may end up returning it before the return window expires.The only other serious complaint is over the touchpad. I fight it all day long. It alternately ignores very definite taps, and then responds to the slightest of all touches from the heel of my hand. This causes the cursor to randomly jump elsewhere on the screen or, as has happened TWICE while writing this, selecting all text in the text field so that your next keystroke overwrites all of it. My MacBook Pro touchpad was always flawless. No amount of adjustment in the Windows settings ends these problems.All said, an stupidity aside, the components and build quality are excellent. This truly is a desktop replacement when it comes to power and graphics performance. Just wish they would fire that one engineer.",1
"I used this pc for work and light gaming, very minimally really. After a few months I noticed some red defective pixels on the left side of the screen.  Long story short, after going through the troubleshooting process that Razer customer service walked me through, they had me wipe the PC and send it to them for repair. I received it back in a timely fashion, re-installed my files, and got back to work.  Now, just 2 weeks later, I have noticed more defective pixels on the right side of the screen. I am loathe to go through the return process again, and wish to return the unit for a refund, as I've had more problems with this ""high end"" machine than any other laptop I've owned.  I'll update this review as the situation unfolds.",1

"I have had this for around a month now. While the computer is able to manage anything I've wanted to do, I wanted to point out two things. One, oddly enough I had to reinstall the battery device as it was telling me right out of the box that it wasn't getting a sufficient charge. A quick fix with some nice people on the Razer forums telling me what to do. The second issue i've had with this computer is that it gets really really hot when I am playing a game. I even have a fan on underneath it but the keyboard, and near the monitor is really hot to the touch, sometimes if i've only been playing 30 minutes. I never experienced any of that with my last gaming laptop. Otherwise I am really happy with the purchase, so far.",1
"Sadly, after many problems with overheating and poor battery charging, the laptop is completely dead and unusable. Died within 4 months an we’ve been waiting on a replacement from their warranty team for almost an additional 3 months. We were assured that we’d have a working computer within a week. The communication with their team has been a nightmare. I honestly think they count on customers giving up. It seems fraudulent at this point. I’ll never buy another Razer product. We’ve had problems with some of their headphones as well, but it’s not worth the hassle of dealing with their team.",1
Great laptop very fast not a gamer but an engineering student and works very well for all my school programs including auto deck,1
"Love that this is sturdy, light weight and aluminum metal covered and I don't think I'll have broken hinges in a year or two like my last two plastic gaming laptops.  That was my biggest concern in looking for a gaming laptop I could use to game a little but mostly to quickly photo edit and use photo shop when on the road.  It is extremely fast, out does my desktop and is now out of 4 pc's the one I use.  It's so quick I can't handle waiting on the others. Last years graphics is fine for the saving I garnered.  I'm a firm believer in I'd still be happy with my last years pc this year.  I easily installed a 2 TB m2 hard drive in the extra slot (love it has an empty slot for that) and the 16 GB ram seems to run my photo editing with fine speed and my older games.  This does not have thunderbolt to connect a display through the C port but has two type C ports that I use to connect all peripherals and then just use the hdmi to connect one monitor and use the laptop screen as a second so don't purchase a C type universal docking station to connect displays, display put through won't work on this 2020 model, i believe it has been updated by razer to work on the 2021 models.  Very very happy with this purchase for my needs.  Oh i thought I would miss the number bad, especially when photo editing but i've adapted to that quickly and do not miss it.",1
"It's time we all realize that Razer makes bad products. For the last 4 years issues with Battery Swelling, overheating and terrible customer service have loomed around us but we discard those due to style, at least I did and I'm paying the price. New system with a bloated battery and bad screen right out the gate and trying to get support from Razer is harder then getting health insurance to cover cosmetic surgery. Razer, step it up!",1

Laptop runs amazing. However I received a unit that came with a dead pixel. Unacceptable especially for a 3k laptop. Amazon won't accept for a replacement for some reason and only a refund... Better off buying it on Best Buy.,1
"I do cooking streams, and this laptop gets the job done! I have not ran any game play on it yet, but may in the future!",1
The laptop is very unique and different than any other laptops I've ever had I would give an A+ to the design. The laptop version I got had a small hard drive which would definitely need upgraded one game takes up almost the whole hard drive or at least 1/3. The laptop also seems to play every game pretty well I do not get into the most high-tech games but I do play the total war Series games and it runs perfect for all those except when it overheats. It seems to overheat very quickly when you start playing a game and this causes the computer itself to freeze crash and shut itself off. And if it doesn't do all that the game usually lags uncontrollably until you give it a timeout and shut it down for a while to cool. The battery life does not last very long even if I'm just running a simple app while having it unplugged it drains fast. If I have it unplugged during a game I'm lucky to get 20 30 minutes out of it. It's quite a shame this is a very unique laptop and I really want to love it but there are issues.,1
Bought for my daughter for her gaming and she loves it. The games no longer have any lag or clipping which was triggering her vertigo. Her only complaint is that when playing any game that she only gets around 2 hours of battery use so she keeps it on the charger when its on.,1
"Payed USD1099 for this Razer base model. At that price this is a steal, at USD 1199 is an excellent purchage but at the original price of USD1599 not worth the money. The SSD included is really low performance. If you plan to really game with this laptop buy a new NVMe ssd storage.Amazing how BAD the sound of the speakers in this laptop, terrible terrible bad quality sound. Not sure why Razer use THX...",1
"Runs great, bought it on prime day, best deal",1
"I bought this for working remote looking at and downloading photographs basically. Has been working great! Battery life is as I'd expect, images and spotted are perfect for what I needed",0
"I bought 2 of these for myself and my partner so we could play some games together. one was New and the other was Used - Very Good.The ""Very Good"" laptop was shipped in a box 20 times it's size with almost no packaging material what so ever, it was twisted and bent so it didn't sit flush with a flat surface anymore and wobbled like a table with a short leg. It was also covered in glue and stains, there was also no charger included.The second laptop, the ""New"" one came packaged fine in it's razer box, but the screen constantly goes black with static.  It does it at random times like in games or just browsing the web.Definitely don't plan on buying another Razer, and never testing my luck with a used laptop from Amazon again.",1
"It is CHEAP for a good reason.1) it uses the generic 180w power adapter with the round plug instead of razer’s proprietary square plug in higher watt models2) probably just me, but the keyboard was mushy, the trackpad wobbled, and the backlight screen was bleeding. QC is bad.3) the motherboard layout is different from ALL reviews and videos you will see on the internet. It uses a 60.8wh battery as oppose to 65wh batteries from the others.4) Latest Razer Blade models use WiFi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2; the cheap 1660ti/120hz model uses WiFi 5 and Bluetooth 5.1. During my test, I get latency issues.You may purchase at your own risk, but be prepared to RMA it. I can’t say that it’s better or worse than it’s relatives,  but it’s definitely built differently than the rest of them. It's a premium laptop, but less premium than the rest of Razer's offering.",1
"We purchased this as an Amazon Prime day deal, and it said near the top of the page that this model was a touchscreen.  We even scrolled through the rest of the options and the ""Human Interface Input"" changed.  That being said, my daughter decided she could learn to live without the touchscreen, but was disappointed.  I am giving this 4 stars, because of false advertising, but may alter that after the laptop has been used more.  We just received the product, but wanted to mention the touchscreen issue.",1
"I love it. It's an amazing computer, with amazing features, and it works great! I have no problems with it, ad I would suggests this Gaming Laptop to others!",1
"UPDATE:I returned this and other other Razer laptops I ordered. Absolutely unusable trackpads. No palm detection whatsoever and completely impossible to adjust any Windows settings, find any specific drivers, or make any registry entries to fix it. Nonstop battles with the mouse jumping all over the screen at the slightest touch from the heel of my hand, while at the same time often ignoring very solid taps. Others complained about this online and the general consensus is that Razer support is apathetic and unresponsive. This experiment with Razer brand is over.====================The closest thing I have found to the excellent build quality of a MacBook Pro. Very solid an inflexible unibody construction and very high end components.However, it is clear that Razor has an engineering staff of nine geniuses and one idiot. In an incredibly boneheaded and unjustifiable move, they have reversed the labeling on the keys. For some asinine reason that serves no purpose other than to make your life miserable, they decided to place the symbols BELOW the numbers instead of above. And all the keys with dual characters (like colon and semicolon) are also backwards from every other keyboard on the planet. Insanity.Everybody's brain is wired to shift UP to the symbols. Not shift DOWN to them. So typing passwords with symbols is now a serious pain. Looking for the period or equal sign or semicolon? I promise you that your eyes will go right to the bottom of the key, and then won't find it. No human being, touch typist or not, recalls whether to shift for the square or curly bracket. You will look, you will see the backwards layout, and then you will type the wrong one. Again, completely idiotic move without the slightest benefit. I still may end up returning it before the return window expires.The only other serious complaint is over the touchpad. I fight it all day long. It alternately ignores very definite taps, and then responds to the slightest of all touches from the heel of my hand. This causes the cursor to randomly jump elsewhere on the screen or, as has happened TWICE while writing this, selecting all text in the text field so that your next keystroke overwrites all of it. My MacBook Pro touchpad was always flawless. No amount of adjustment in the Windows settings ends these problems.All said, an stupidity aside, the components and build quality are excellent. This truly is a desktop replacement when it comes to power and graphics performance. Just wish they would fire that one engineer.",1
"I'm really happy with this computer. I'm not a gamer but have to run several programs at once so a friend recommended this. The color changing keyboard is super cool and the laptop is very sleek and nice looking. Battery life and performance are great. It's a bit heavy but very sturdy. My only complaint is that the track pad is a bit large so I'll accidentally hit it sometimes while I'm typing. If you use an external mouse, though, you can disable the track pad so it's not as much of a problem. Overall would highly recommend.",0
"So I bought this towards the end of last year and let me tell you: This runs a LOT better than my old PC. I bought it initially so I could bring it with me to petsittings (I house sit dogs for a living) and I have been able to start my portfolio in voice acting as a result! If you want a good PC for gaming and to re-discover old hobbies you forgot you loved, BUY THIS GAMING DESKTOP! It is also super easy to buy an SSD card for more memory and the like on here if you'd like. If I had one complaint, it is simply that it comes without an ethernet port, but this is easy to remedy, I assure you!",1
"Bought: 8/28/21Received: 9/2/213 months pass....Broke: 12/4/21Problem? Where to begin....Before the complete meltdown of this device, I encountered constant overheating. The ""feet"" of the laptop are mega small, and the fans are on the bottom, so the fans are blocked at all times.... This caused a ton of over heating, even when doing basic things like Facebook, email, or typing up reports.... I can't imagine what would happen if you tried to actually game on it!Then the day came where I started it up, it worked for a solid 10 minutes, then the screen went black. I tried shutting it down, restarting it, connecting it to a different screen.... nothing worked. I tried contacting Amazon, but it was passed the return policy date, so I had to contact Razer.A company by gamers for gamers, right?I contacted them immediately on 12/4/21. I was asked for details, like purchase date, location, device info, all the relevant stuff.... I sent it on the same day. Then they wanted video of the problem, and photos that the device wasn't physically broken. Sent! Finally, the time came where they asked me to send my product in. I waited for them to tell me what was wrong. 20 days later, 12/24/21, they send me a quote, on a product that's under warranty, with zero explanation!After being bounced around for a month, they want to charge me $356.49 to fix the motherboard. Why wont they cover it? They claim I dropped it and that there's damage. Good thing I have those photos and videos that they asked for!$356.49 in addition to the original $1278. This laptop is not worth that. It is poor quality, over heats, and broke in 3 months. The RAZER support team is also less than stellar to work with. All in all..... wish I paid a little extra for an ASUS.....",1
"Took a gamble and bought ""Used - Very Good"" and the condition was basically perfect.Been using for 4 months and so far only had a few ""issues"" that were resolved (by me).1. Heard electric whine coming from laptop. Was concerned at first but noticed my other laptops also do it... seems normal for laptops.2. Games were suddenly very sluggish with huge fps drops. I just had to update the GPU drivers and it was fixed. (I didnt think to do this right away). Mainly play csgo and easily run at 300fps. Sometimes play apex and have no issues except it cant run apex at 150fps+.3. Speaking of Apex... the laptop gets VERY hot for intense games. I plug external monitor+mouse+keyboard so its not a big issue but it WILL heat up your room. The room temperature increase is noticeable. I dont think it's feasible to play on the laptop keyboard when playing something like Apex since the laptop gets too hot. My palms get sweaty and overall not a pleasant experience. The vapor cooling seems to work pretty well though... even when gaming for 10hours+ at high temps I dont get performance drops which is amazing imo. I considered getting a fan that sits under the laptop but it doesnt seem necessary. We'll see how it holds up over time.4. One day, bluetooth stopped working entirely. It just disappeared... even from Device Manager. I googled the issue and a BIOS reset fixed it.PROS:Build quality feels great. Impressed by it. Almost at mbp level.Great performance. I've played csgo, apex, gtav, mordhau, and valorant all with no issues.Screen looks pretty good. Not mbp level but better than average laptop screen imo. I'd imagine the 4k 60hz looks even better. (higher refresh rates monitors almost always look worse than lower rate picture-focused monitors)Does not come with a bunch of bloatware. (i hate bloatware w a passion)CONS:The laptop keyboard is HORRIBLE. Travel distance is so low it's annoying to use.You must install their proprietary razer software to customize the keyboard lighting.Gets VERY hot.Brand doesnt seem to have a good reputation for longevity so I do worry that it will randomly die on me one day.Logo on the lid is very ugly in my opinion.Wish it had one more usb c port.Overall, it's an extremely difficult task to compete with Apple and I'm happy that Razer put effort into creating a high end product that feels fairly polished. Four months in and I'm pleased with my purchase.Some misc thoughts... I dont think it was necessary for the screen to go up to 300hz... 240 is good enough imo... Would be nice if, for future versions, they got rid of the huge charger and made it usb c charge. Would be nice if I could buy a version with no webcam and they got rid of the top bezel.",1
best gaming laptop company!!!,1
The keyboard is not a full size keyboard but razer has all the functionalities embedded in it. You could buy separate keyboard if you are not used to it. Other than these minute matters I don't have anything to say as Razer has and is living up to its name.,1
"I've had a lot of computers and laptops over the past 30 years. One thing that has gotten progressively worse (and annoying) is all the bloatware. Almost every manufacturer ads their own support aps, anti virus, market place, etc. All they do it slow it down and bug up the system.This is my first Razer and I'm never going back. They only ad 1 app and that's to program all the RGBs and tweak the system performance. It's a subtle app too.Combined with the great hardware they put in their systems, the build quality is what really sets it apart. I got mine for engineering work. Other brands add an ""enterprise tax"" to anything they say I'd for professional use or if it mentions CAD in the description.I run Fusion 360 on this with no issues. Renders like butter too.",0
"I'm a graphic designer and video editor, so I wanted a laptop that could handle having 5 Adobe programs open without pooping out, and that, unlike Mac, could be upgraded and also run games. This was an investment purchase I hoped to use for a long time.I'm still in the over-cautious phase of the big purchase and have only used the laptop at a desk and sitting upright, I've been cautious about not over-charging even though it claims to have a system that protects from over-charging, and kept the charging cable untangled and didn't really move it while plugged in. So color me surprised when in just under a month, the battery stopped charging and the laptop died as soon as it was unplugged.After some googling and forums I initially brushed off as 1/10000 chances when I was researching laptops, this battery issue has been a problem since 2015 that they still haven't solved. Customer service troubleshot the problem to be the charging port., Don't bother emailing them because they say to wait three days or more for a response over email. Instead, I used their chat feature in customer service and the guy was nice enough and walked me through some troubleshooting to figure out the problem that I had to describe like three times. He assumed I just had a 100W USB-C cable on hand to use as a secondary charging device, something not included with the laptop, which also didn't work. And now I have to send out a laptop I bought LESS THAN A MONTH AGO for repair that could take 2 weeks, half the time I've had the laptop.UPDATE:The customer service team is clearly run out of the USA, likely India. They have absolutely no skill or authority to talk about issues and use weird, confusing phrases, and never respond to questions. Iconic phrases such as:""the Battery that needs to be replaced is out of stock."", followed by an email the next day saying, ""We received an update from our Repair Team that the battery has been replenished."" Which then took three emails asking if that means the battery has been replaced or not, one of which contained a request for information on refunds because I did not want a laptop with the same broken battery. One of those emails even said 'Sorry for the confusion!' then proceeded to not clear up anything at all.When they did answer it, what I got was ""With regard to your query, by the time our team inspected your unit with faulty battery, we haven't had stocks for the battery parts yet. That was why, you were offered with the unit replacement instead. For some reason, our parts have been restocked,"" So, for some reason parts were restocked. And I was brushed off on my concerns. Any questions about returns were directed to their website, so clearly the customer support team has no authority to actually do anything or answer any questions.All of it is sprinkled in with a frustratingly upbeat ""Hope your day is as good as mine."" and ""Giving you excellent service is always a pleasure."" I'm having to pass up freelance work and not getting questions answered, so no, my day isn't going great and I'm not getting excellent service, but good luck finding someone at Razer to express that too because the customer service team doesn't even read emails.",0
Love it runs like a champion,1
"Nothing, no issues",1
Great product! No other laptop better than this for the price ritgh now,1
"In terms of what I like... The quality feel, the performance, the fact this model includes Windows Hello facial recognition camera, and the lack of tons of junk pre-installed. This thing performs like a champ for what I'm using it to do.In terms of what I dislike... not much. Battery isn't as good as a less performant device, but that's obvious considering it's a high powered gaming laptop. No, what I dislike most is the custom power adapter connector instead of a more common connector like what Dell, HP, and others use. This isn't a problem for the one that comes with the laptop, but if you're like me and want to order extras or need to replace it, they're very expensive.",0
"Overall, this is an amazing laptop for the price. The build quality is fantastic and the screen gets very bright and vibrant. The small problem that I had was that the touchpad would active while typing sometimes which could interfere with what you are doing. Also, the storage is not enough for gaming and regular use, but I fixed this by buying my own nvme drive and replacing it. I purposely bought this laptop to upgrade the storage on my own which worked perfectly fine.",1

"This computer has done great with all of the games that I've played, but the battery life is the worst I've seen on any computer. It lasts maybe 2 hours before a low battery notification. However, this isn't an issue for me since I don't take this computer on the go.",1
Great,1
"Got the laptop on Prime Day, so have had it over 5 months.  Pretty solid laptop that I use for work.  MAJOR downfall is, me and more seasoned computer people than I, cannot get more than 1 external monitor to connect.  I deal with spreadsheets all day and need 2 external monitors.  1 HDMI port works great, connecting a monitor thru the USB-C ports just doesnt work.  Had I known this I would not have purchased so disappointed in this laptop.  If you dont need 2 external monitors, it works great for normal computer use.  I dont game, so no clue there.",1
"Hello all! I hope my review can be helpful to someone out there. I purchased the 2070 max q advance model on prime day. After about 6 days I started jumping up and down as the kid in me was so excited to get a best of a computer. This was going to be a upgrade as I have been rocking a old 2009 mac pro and definitely was time to upgrade. Ups gave me the package and I just could not help my sled to get it open as soon as I possibly can! Only problem was that I received the base model 2060 max p. That a 1k laptop vs the 2k laptop I bought. I was very disappointed, this was my first major computer purchase and my first major amazon purchase. I hope amazon can get me set up but I don't have my fingers crossed. After this I will not be making a major purchase with amazon. When you spend 2k for something you should receive what you purchased not something that is more then half the price",1
"The laptop is just great. Fells like a hight quality build. Screen has a beautiful display. RGB Chroma makes it look cool. Most importantly it runs most games out there at 1920 x 1080 resolution on ultra high settings with no noticeable FPS drops. Yes it does get hot when running games at those settings but if you play it in an A/C cooled room, connected to a TV via HDMI, it doesnt get as hot. And its How I always used the laptopThat is also why my review is a 2 Star rating. In less than one year the HDMI port on my laptop stopped working. The computer does detect the TV and lets me assign a resolution for it but theres no display on my TV. Its funny that one should pay over $2000 on a computer for it to start breaking apart in less than a year. After trying litterally every troubleshooting step I could find and contacting Razer they decided I should send the computer for repair. And as of now Im waiting for them to reply to me. Havent heard from them since before yesterday.I will update the review as the story develops. But as of now I could not justify their ultra expensive release prices for their products if they are not even going to outlast the manufacturers warranty.Update 1: Razer will sell their products to Puerto Rico customers. Even on their webise they will ship them to Puerto Rico. Even Best Buy stores in the island sell Razer products. But in case of a warranty claim. If the product needs to be sent for repairs/replacement, it has to be sent first to an address in the USA so it can then be sent to Razer.This might also apply to any US territory. So, dear purchaser please consider it seriously before purchasing from Razer. Specially if you live in a US territory like Puerto Rico.Update 2: It turns out that Razer does offer direct warranty support to Puerto Rico. Seems like some CSR were misinformed. In the end I was able to send the faulty laptop to razer and they sent if back repaired. Had to wait about a week which ia not that bad.Im giving it a 3 star review because while my problem was resolved is the 1st time I had a new laptop go bad on me in less that a year, that and the misinformation on behalf of customer service.Overall Razer has cool looking products but theres always a chance of buying something that might not last. If its under warranty then youre covered.",1
"If you're worried about the hardware being outdated, do not be. Dying light 2 maxed to the limit connected to a monitor averages 65fps with drops to 50 in high activity sequences. I usually get 100-130 fps on all low settings. Rainbow 6 on Vulkan averaged 250fps. Both connected to a monitor-bypassing intel graphics. If you play on the display that is on the laptop, you will see a 10-20fps drop at higher fps. However, the display is still great, but 300hz is a gimic, you'll never see anything higher than 240 on a consistent basis. If you're wondering, you cannot play Minecraft RTX on this machine, it didn't give me the option no matter how hard I tried. COD Warzone multi ran at around 120 at low. The laptop has great build quality. But, the keyboard, infuriates me. The keyboard experience is horrendus for typing at high speeds/touch typing. The Dell G5 and Asus zephryus are vastly better for typing although the razer has the better performance of the three. You should expect 2-3 hours of battery life with medium activity such as a few browser tabs. Cooling isn't the greatest but it's passable. GPU never went above 80c on high gaming loads.Tl;dr: it's great in every way, except the keyboard, the keyboard is trash.",1
