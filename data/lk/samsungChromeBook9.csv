This Chromebook has a fast response time.Touch screen is very easy to use.UHD screen is very beautiful.This is the best Chromebook.,0
Theses Chrome Books looked and performed like brand new with a very reasonable price.,1
"Haven't used only tested it, been in case",1
I only had it for a month and it stopped working,1
"This is an excellent computer. I had one before that was defective and this was a replacement. It's really well made of solid machined aluminum and very attractive in the ""fiesta red"" color. Battery life is good depending on usage of course but I do get all-day mixed use of 6-8 hours of screen time. The screen is a beauty and the general performance is more than adequate; speedy reactions to input with rarely any lag at all. I got this as an alternative to a windows computer because I felt like I really didn't need all those capabilities with my typical use. I haven't found anything to complain about and I am quite happy with this purchase.",1
"Esperaba que fuera mas lento, pero para los estudios de mis hijos es mas que suficiente",1
"Freezes up, lock screen can restart 5x's daily.Stock trading impossible on crap machine. Cost you hundreds in poor response.Blinking screen.Not COMPATIBLE with many, many, many, many appsCHROME OS? niche' junkSLOW LAPTOP",1
"Honestly the battery gets a bad reputation but it isn’t as bad as it’s portrayed. Yes it is short you only get 4-6 hours or so with full brightness. After a couple weeks you get in the habit of charging it when your not using it. Once you get used to keeping it charged it lasts all night or all day no problem. The best laptop I have had personally. Screen has great quality, the color is amazing, loads extremely fast and does very well with having multiple tabs open at once. A solid 9.5 out of 10 for me. 1 con I found is overtime the mousepad is easily subject to damage if not cared for properly. With everyday use it’s no problem but not very durable with drops.",0
"Only had a day so far, but very impressed.Update: After about five months of daily use, my daughter continues to get excellent results from this device, for both school work and personal entertainment.  I added a solid screen protector, just in case.Zero negative comments about this device. But have decided to get a magnetic adapter for connecting the charging cable, to avoid damaging the charge-cable when removing it.",1
Just got this today.  Works great! No cosmetic damage at all. Has an AUE date of June of 2027. So basically 5 years of automatic updates.,1
"This is a review that I am going to try to keep brief, but I might fail. Here's why: The Samsung Galaxy Chromebook has had some of the most unfair reviews I have ever read about an inanimate object, and I'd like to clear the air of some of those comments.Let's start with the only thing I agree with from so many negative reviews, and that agreement is 'somewhat' at best, and that's the fact that the battery life is not all that great. Some would say it is terrible, I would say that is true if only going by specs alone. But, in real-life usage by a couch potato like myself, is a minor inconvenience. Why? Well, because I do not use my Chromebook in a manner that requires I run on battery power more than 3 or four hours at a time. If after something between 3 and 5 hours, I get low on battery I do what I have always done... I plug it in! I am not being silly, but serious. I plug it in and keep going for a while, then I unplug it and keep going some more.YES, I could not do that in the forest, at the beach, or on a long flight. But my use case does not require that any longer, like it did when I was an executive in the computer business, taking long flights.SO, if your use case or use model allows plugging in now and then, and 3-plus hours will get you what you need and you can plugin for a while at that point, THAT is what real-world usage is like for many many users of this machine.Next, and last, on the agreed-to complaints list of other reviews is that, yes, the machine does heat up sometimes, but no differently than does my $3500 Apple MacBook Pro every now and then. There isn't a lot to say about that, other than it is not constant nor always-so but does occur about as often and gets about as warm, as my Mac laptops have occasionally become.These two main points are in agreement with similar points on other reviews. But many, if not most, of the other points on clearly negative reviews, are less than objective or real-world, in my opinion.For example, I read a review that said the glass screen was so thin if was prone to break, and that the trackpad was just too small, that the hinges were terrible, that the keyboard was terrible, and on and on. All of which is categorically false, and is not a realistic appraisal of the machine, especially when compared with other very high-end laptops, such as some Apple models, some other high-end Chromebooks such as those from Samsung and Google's own offerings.Now... for the sweet sauce, the good points about this amazingly cool little machine... read on.This machine is thin... really thin. So much so, that for the 1st few days I found myself handling it like the newborn baby it was, but soon I reverted to treating it like a laptop computer. All to say this thing is built really well, AND that it is a top-tier piece of precision electronics like a high-end camera or sophisticated medical device. But while it is not unduly delicate, it does deserve a degree of understanding that it is not a 1-inch thick block of ABS plastic, so use and treat it accordingly.Next, the hinges, no complaints from me. Some reviewers claim they are lousy because the lid/screen will oscillate a bit when adjusted. True. And so does every really thin lid machine I have ever owned. Bu tin the real world, we don't do that, do we? We adjust the screen position and carefully, and it stays put.Next, the keyboard, it is every bit as good, and perhaps better than the keys on any Mac portable I've used for the past 5 plus years, in fact, I think it is a little bit better because the key-travel feels a little bit longer, which can make for better feedback and improved speed.No need to comment on the display, it's simply about as good as it can be. Literally. I don't think you can get a better screen on any laptop today. And many of the reviewers panned the machine because of a lack of 4K video material to consume. Someone should tell them it isn't the machine's issue, is it?Sound. The sound is fine, again, consider what you just purchased, it is not a Bose foldback bass design with an array of 6 drivers for sound. It is an amazingly thin laptop, and it sounds just fine. Does it get loud enough? Yes. Does it get really really really loud? No.The hinges are fine, too. My only complaint is that when fully opened into tablet-style, the lid doesn't lock into place, and my copy floated about 1/8th of an inch above the base unit when handheld at an angle. When in tablet configuration and laying flat, as on a desk or table, the lid was flush as it should be. A little annoying at most.All the great features you've read about are absolutely true of this machine. It is simply the best laptop I have ever owned. In terms of the build detail, it meets, and actually, IMPO surpasses, many if not all major laptop manufacturers' latest designs, especially in the Chromebook marketplace, where this machine may be the best, again, depending on your individual feature, functions, and use-case needs.Performance-wise the included i5 10th generation Clearlake U chipset seems to me to outperform or minimally to keep up with my 2015 Google Pixel Chromebook which used an i7 2.6Ghz processor married to 16GB of RAM. This machine I am reviewing has a chip that moves along at 1.6Ghz and throttles up to 3.9 (some spec sheets rate it above 4.x Ghz) and as such I have had zero performance issues even though it has 8 GB of RAM. So performance-wise, I am very pleased.Would I have been happy if I'd spent $1,000 (actually $999) on this machine? Well, my 2015 machined aluminum, best of breed, Google Pixel Chromebook (the second release in that brand/line) cost me over $1,200 when new, and I never looked back. This machine was discounted to $799 a year ago, and now that it is replaced with the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2, this original Galaxy Chromebook can be had for $599 new while inventory supplies are available. At that price, I would replace it in a micro-second if mine was damaged or lost.Those of us who have been Chromium OS and Chromebook pioneers have been rewarded with an ever increase of Chromebook capabilities in both the hardware and the apps and operating system. This machine, the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook (original version) is a real winner in every way, and while battery life is not top-of-class, this reviewer asserts that pretty much everything else is, and for $600, I am very happy with my purchase.I hope this review has been helpful, regardless of what you end up purchasing when shopping for your next Chromebook computer.",0
It's a cool little Chromebook  I was skeptical at 1st to get it after reading the reviews because they said the battery life and the functionality between apps and Microsoft to stuff like that and that  It got hot really quick but that has not been the case for me it is the case if you leave it flat on a surface and don't let the fans have time to blow the air going down part about it is it doesn't have regular USB slot so I had to get a connection to plugging a side mouse for it ask for it other than that the laptop's good it's really really quick and all the functionality on it's pretty cool,0
OKThe screen resolution and color are poor.,1
"Its sad my daughter bought this with her first check this year.... it worked well for awhile then all of sudden it doesnt charge anymore.  I contacted Amazon it was a 90 day warranty.  I was told to contact the seller, there is no contact information.  She only had it for six months now, its sad Amazon will not help her and the company make sure you will not be able to contact them if anything goes wrong.  Bad Customer Service!",0
"It is almost similar to MT8183 chromebooks in similar conditions (4GB RAM, 32GB STORAGE). Battery last less than MT8183 chromebooks. My main concern is this freezes frequently despite powerwash it, maybe it is due this is a renewed chromebook or maybe it is a 64bit version (32bit seems more stable).",1
I bought this laptop to start online school but it's capable of so much more!,1
"if you want an inexpensive chromebook, do not hesitate to buy this.  for me, this is exactly what i wanted and does everything that i need it to. battery life has blown me away.  no complaints whatsoever.i would certainly recommend this.",1
I've had a few chromeboooks and this is the best and high-quality one. I have not had the battery problems people mentioned - getting around six hours of basic surfing and watching movies; maybe Samsung/Google made some software updates to alleviate the problem.  I really love it. I think it is the best chromebook on the market ... still.,1
"For the limited time I have used this unit I am impressed. No concerns with having purchased a renewed unit. My needs for a laptop are fulfilled to the degree that if this unit functions well over a respectable time period, it will eliminate the need to replace my current unit (and more expensive) that features that are simply never utilized. Only drawback at this time is the smaller screen compared to my laptop currently used.",0
This is one of the best items I have ever purchased from Amazon. This Chromebook was basically new without one single scratch or blemish. The price was fair I am very glad I pulled the trigger and will recommend this seller to my huge network. Thank you!,0
"Charger doesn’t work, chat support was useless and can’t get in touch with anyone to remedy this situation. Just need a charger.",1
"When I first received the laptop I was unable to login because the laptop hadn't been factory reset but, after contacting technical support I was able resolve the problem easily. I'm still finding out how to navigate my laptop but, so far my laptop has exceeded my expectations 😊",1
"I was so frustrated trying to use this thing when I first got it that I ended up just not using it and using my work laptop instead. Over the past few months I would occasionally pull it out and after a few times I discovered the mouse touchpad would just completely stop responding. Touching the screen and then moving the mouse again seems like the only reliable method to get it fixed but it seems to have gotten worse and worse.I suspect this is  an issue with the touchpad itself, possibly just needs to be reconnected. The really annoying thing is that there isn't any advanced touchpad or stylus settings that makes it naively able to disable one or the other. Regardless, this was one of the most expensive chromebooks out there and in hindsight I wish I'd gotten the Lenovo that my wife ended up getting last month.Outside the 90 day return window so now I need to go through the hoops of talking with Samsung support to see if they'll cover it under warranty..",1
"We ordered four so our kids could use the play store to be able to access the new Teaching Textbooks 4.0 app, and they meet that need.They came in generic laptop boxes and were packaged very well for shipping. Each one included a factory USB C charge cable and block.I was pleasantly surprised at the condition of the computers. They all looked BRAND NEW. Only one even has a mark and I wiped that mark off with my finger.I booted each one up and attached the charger to ensure they would charge and they did. Each one booted and found our WiFi perfectly.This Chromebooks look and function as new. The kids have been using them for school for a couple days now and have zero issues with them at all.",0
"once i found out how to do it it synced all my old Chromebook info to new, very happy with product",1
"Very pleased. Long battery life. Good enough picture quality and screen size to make personal viewing of movies and videos pleasurable. Slim. Sturdy. Keyboard adequate size for my clumsy, fat fingers. Love it.",1
"The Chromebook that I received was in such good condition it was almost brand new. There was no scratches, screen was clean. Easy to set up. No bumps in the road. I bought it for writing and doing small bits and pieces of editing and it has really worked out well. Another reason I bought this is because I looove going to coffee shops to read and such. Now I can go get coffee and write too! It's a really nice computer that seems to be up to date and will stay that way for awhile. :)",1
"I am pleased with just about everything with this laptop except the battery life. Actually, the battery life isn't as bad as I was led to think by other reviewers. So long as I dial back the screen brightness a bit I get about five hours, which isn't too bad for my usage. But not a battery life champ. In every other respect, this laptop is definitely five stars and has become my favorite.",0
"I was not aware when I bought this device, that it operated on a totally different operating system that would take me days and days to learn.  I heard about the screen brightness, clarity, etc and that was not immediately the case for me.  It took a lot of research for me to figure out how to achieve all the magic tricks this little Chromebook has to offer.  It is a fantastic device at the end of the day.  Everything is made compact and you have to learn how it all works, if not familiar with the OS and the device itself.  From an aesthetic sense, it is gorgeous, small, thin, and the red is a must!  The touch screen is incredible as is the stylus capability.  I do think, though, it is about $300 overpriced.",1
"I had very gracefully tripped over the power cable on my old Chromebook. Fortunately the only thing I broke was not my knees, but the screen on my computer. 24 hours later I had this replacement in my home set up and running.Nice little machine. Perfectly clean and functional; you'd never know it was not brand new. It was packed very professionally and shipped out immediately. Talk about caring for the customer! Wow. And the price fit my budget. I'd gladly buy from this seller again.",1
"Very pleased. Long battery life. Good enough picture quality and screen size to make personal viewing of movies and videos pleasurable. Slim. Sturdy. Keyboard adequate size for my clumsy, fat fingers. Love it.",0
"The screen quality is absolutely amazing, the whole design is slick and nice. Its also very light. Also, this chromebook is easy to use and manage. I have nothing negative to say about my purchase. Its worth the price you spend!",0
"its awesome, i bought it for my kid, you can play roblox but it runs a bit slow,",1
Looks great and the screen is absolutely  beautiful!,1
"I bought this as a Christmas gift for a friend, she loves it. She uses it for streaming her shows and online school.",1
Traveling convenient!,0
"Better than I thought any Chromebook could be. We are an apple family but IOS is problematic with google classroom. And the Chromebooks they give the students at school really are not built for the heavy use (kinda cheap) This Chromebook is a lot of fun and packed with high-end features, that said it costs $1000 so it better be good!",1
"Thin, lightweight, crystal clear screen, incredibly easy to navigate I could not be any happier.  However, I would never do business with this reseller ever again. No where does it state that you will pay a 20% restocking fee, very deceptive business practices.",0
"Honestly… the screen resolution is phenomenal! However multi-tasking is flimsy. I feel like my 2010 MacBook Air is better at multi-tasking. Also, it heats up within an hour or so of using it. The computer did arrive with a dead battery which I can see why as having a full battery ship can be explosive. But the same did I received the computer, I did notice the trackpad was causing me a lot of issues. Like a lot!! The trackpad was not working at all. Period. I even tried cleaning the trackpad with a dry microfiber cloth to see if it will help and it didn’t. Had to use the laptop as a tablet to be able to use the computer. I love the screen but I have ny doubts, honestly. May return! Samsung please fix these issues on the next model. Thank you.",1
"If I needed a computer merely for streaming content and wanted the best quality and highest resolution, then this is the clear leader and without exception the best offered in the market.  If you need it to do other things it is best to look at something else.Despite the short battery life (around 4 hours of continuous use video streaming of Amazon prime HD offerings), I was willing to accept that, but constant and continuous other issues resulted in making me nuts.  So what are the issues?1. It gets hot and I don't mean warm, I mean hot enough to redden the skin if you are holding it on your lap.  Everytime it got that hot which happens after using it for over a hour or so, I would elevate it on a rack I use for cooling cookies when they come out of the oven.  This allowed air to constantly be under the laptop.  Did it help?  No.  If you are intending to use this for several hours straight, you need to invest in a base which has a fan blowing cool air onto the bottom.  This means the portabiity just went out the window.2. Touchscreen fails to respond.  It is maddening to be in the middle of a project only to have your touch screen stop responding to touch, provided epen, touch pad or cursor with a mouse.  It was necessary to close everything down and restart the computer to fix it.3.  Keyboard touches opens random programs.  This one was really puzzling.  I would be typing and all of a sudden an program would open.  I assumed I must have inadvertently touched something on the keyboard while typing, but have no clue as to what it was.  Since I didn't know what caused it, I was unable to avoid doing it.4. Weird keyboards show up on touch screen and you cant get them to close.  I know there are times when you are using this in tablet mode that you want the keyboard to be on the screen.  However why one would appear when you are typing was yet another mystery.  How to get rid of it was equally puzzling.  To add insult to injury, the keyboard which would show up differed from one time to another.  Occasionally it was the Qwerty type, but frequently it was not.  (One of them had row upon row of yellow circle face icons for heavens sake!)  I would get rid of one only to have another show up.5. Settings change without my input.  You go to settings and have the computer's cursor, screen layout, wallpaper etc all set up to your own personal preferences.  Then without any rhyme or reason they are changed.  Yes it is easy to go back and set them again, but I shouldn't have to do this and it is a pain in the butt to keep reconfiguring they physical look of the display.6. Bluetooth devices don't always stay paired.  Once you have scanned and selected a blue tooth device, I am used to it always being on the list of available devices which you can then click to quickly reconnect.  Here on a few occasions I had to go back to the repairing process to get them to connect.  Again another time waster.There were othe6 I knew about before I purchased such as there only being a couple C type outlets.  I had this issue with another Samsung product so had already purchased the doogle (dongle?) so that I could plug in my memory cards, usb and micro USB cords.Other positives are the look. This had to be the best looking laptop I have ever seen.  Only the blue Samsung Galaxy laptop for windows looks as good. The built in epin when working was fabulous.  You could set it up to magnify the screen, take a screenshot, etc so it allowed versatility not often seen in similar chromebooks.  It is fast.  Everything moved so quickly, and the processing was better than any other chromebook I have used to date.I know the new Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2 has worked to solve some of these issues.  Unfortunately that has been done at the expense of factors which made the thing so great to start out with.  In short if these are ever just a few hundred dollars I will get one for video streaming as I do a lot of it.  But for over 600.?  No not ever.",1
No Arabic input language,1
"If you have galaxy products in your home, they are all integrated. Software optimization is still in its infancy, but it's understandable due to the Intel vs. Qualcomm rivalry. The android/linux app development is built into the OS. Future models might benefit from larger RAM sizes on the main board, but you can always partition a bit of your virtual memory as ram if things slow down. It's really designed for the people who hate having to get virtual box and android emulators.",1
This is a premium quality chrome book for the price. My only complaint is that the battery life is a little low.,0
"Very poor and buggy.os crashes every time the screen is off (sometimes even when the screen is on) and falls into recovery mode..,the screen panel just unstable and swinging like crazy, which makes it impossible to draw with the pen,battery life also terrible,Netflix app support only 480p resolutionthe 4k screen is just useless exept youtube,Linux is too limited and slow.very very bad purchase.Samsung messed up big time!Don't waste your money!!",0
I uninstalled Chrome OS and  put Linux Ubuntu 22.04. for my nephew to play Roblox and he still uses it for emails and his school work.,1
"very nice look, thin, everything works quickly on the touch of a finger and on the phone as it is nearby worth buying I recommend",0
it was fine until the keybord stop working,1
"I have been using it for almost 6 months. So its very good  premium looking chromebook, an eye turner in red colour. Works flawless. Read about chromebooks in detail before buying to see if it suits. 4K panel is amazing to look at, at cost of lower battery life. I am able to manage 3 to 4 hours of battery in browsing. It syncs with my s21 ultra very well.  Speakers are ok types, get work done. Recommended product.",0
"I never used the computer. After trying to find a keyboard cover and hardshell cover, I came to realize per many reviews that the high resolution screen is battery intensive to a fault, as well as heat producing. Some say the battery will only last 4 hours. The large perforated area on the bottom is to dissipate the heat generated by the power hungry screen. Honestly, I just took it out of the box and put it back and returned it after realizing there were no keyboard covers or polycarbonate cases for this model. Although I never actually even turned it on, if you read the reviews and see the screen resolution, you will see why the aftermarket industry leaves it alone. I think the screen overburdens the device.",1
"Yup, after exhaustive research I purchased the Intel I-5 version.  So far no complaints .. Screen quality, sound, keyboard, touch screen, battery life and camera ... excellent. Trust me, I've built desktop computers from parts for video editing, I play on-line games on my gaming laptop, and since it was purchased for my wife; no even one ""honey how do you do this?""",0
"If this product actually got the reported 11 hours of battery life, this would be a 5 star review. The overall build quality of the Chromebook and the screen quality is absolutely brilliant. I was a bit nervous about Chrome OS, but its incredibly intuitive and feels a lot like Mac OS. Linux apps were a bit of a hassle to download, but they ran perfectly.The battery life is just unacceptable. After multiple tries, I was not able to get more than 4 hours of battery on less than 50% brightness. This Chromebook cannot be used as a mobile machine, unless you plan on being next to an outlet all the time. I bought this Chromebook for taking notes in class, but this wouldn't even last a half a day of classes. Only buy this if you don't plan on using it while mobile. It also can get hot to the touch, but it never went above 70 C.I ended up returning the Chromebook and got the Samsung Galaxybook Pro 360 instead, and I'm much happier with this purchase. It doesn't beat the screen on Samsung's Chromebook, but the battery life last all day and there's only a noticeable difference in the screen quality when up close.",1
"Awesome machine, the best designed laptop i've ever seen and hold. Material and design quality 5 stars. Battery life good if you keep brightness below 50% ( which is kind of enough indoors ) . Super fast in everything it does . The only negative thing that bothers me is that the amoled screen while 4k and capable of incredible HDR due to oled infinite constrast ratio is using pentile arrangement as far as i can tell , which leads to an overal grainy image particularly when bright light colors are displayed. It creates an image that looks well below 4k res despite the huge ppi . I wish samsung would choose the classic rgb arragentment and avoid this.",1
This computer worked very well for my college needs. Writing papers and checking the internet were a breeze!,1
"Perfect for my needs.  So light and portable.  And fast.  Love the touchscreen.  And the screen resolution is amazing.  Breaking up with Windows was scary, but no regrets!",0
My Chromebook is a refurbished model but is absolutely like brand new!  I couldn't be happier.,1
Good balance between travel weight and computing power.  The latest intel i5 CPU makes it a power house for most android/linux application.,1
"So, I took a wild chance on this because the price was so low and it was refurbished.  I am replacing a Chromebook in which the AUE (automatic update expiration) date was June of 2022.  I asked the question about this Samsung's AUE and I received no response.  I figured I would buy and just return it if it was unsatisfactory.  After power-up the first thing I did was check the AUE in settings and discovered that it wasn't until JUNE of 2027!!!  That's great news.If you don't know what AUE is and you are buying a chromebook you should probably do some research on this before you make a purchase.  Amazon is literally selling chromebooks with as little as 3 months left until AUE... These are units that did not qualify for the google one-year extension.Anyways, besides the AUE I have tested the sound, screen, keypad... ALL GOOD.  It's obvious that it has been slightly USED, but who cares at the price point.The only remaining test is the battery.  If I can get 4-5 hours out of a full charge that will satisfy my needs.",1
"This is the ultimate computer.  Fast, fast fast seemed like I would be at the screen for a web site that I selected even before I removed the mouse from the icon selecting it.  The build is beautiful and a joy to hold. But I think my greatest joy is to be away from Windows operating system, should have done that years ago. Battery life is no problem for me, I’m sure I should be away from this device long enough to charge it.Don’t hesitate buy this Samsung Chrome  Book or one built with the same configuration.  Did I mention the screen is the finest screen on any computer available, read about it.  Good bye Windows.",1
"I use this product for pretty much everything. It's not as fast as I would have liked, but it's fast enough, and I hate it's not a touch screen. But a wireless mouse takes care of that. The price wasn't to shabby either, the battery seems to last for me several days anyway.",1
"This is my second Samsung Chromebook.  It does everything I need and performs especially well within the Google universe.  This new version is stunning in appearance and shape,",1
I really want to love this product because it is very convenient but the touchpad goes out after being on for 15 minutes. I thought in the first month it was a glitch but it has proved to be repetitive. It is very inconvenient and makes this product not good. If it isn't a samsung error it is a faulty product I was sent. Does anyone else have issues with the mouspad.,1
"Wafer-thin and packed with Chromebook features, the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2020 (Galaxy from now on) is a beauty. In Fiesta Red, the Galaxy catches eyes and the form build looks like a colorful piece of thick cardboard.  Currently, Amazon is selling this for $799.99 ($200 less than I purchased the unit a week ago.) I work with Windoze and Mac professionally but at home, I enjoy using several Samsung tablets, the Chromebook Pro and other quality products from the company.I was really on the fence as I have a Samsung Pro from 2 years back and it does all that I need, Yet the lure of a better screen and CPU chip finally enticed me. I also welcome the Bluetooth 5 for earbuds and the lightness of the overall unit.As others have mentioned, the battery life when using the quality screen settings are a little below four hours, weak compared to the Asus Flip, with almost better specs- but the Flip doesn't have the quality screen this unit does. (I'm not carrying a charger with me when a battery pack will do the job.)The added functionality of Android apps, which are not always available with other brands, make this Galaxy a winner. Besides, I am a Samsung fan. At $800. this is a worthy contender to Best Chromebook of 2020.",0

Great deal for the money. Not the most high quality screen but the value!!! Is amazing. Best purchase ever.,1
"This is a beautiful machine. Solid build, snappy color, great screen, easy to use keys and trackpad. I did my research and knew of possible problems with heat and low battery life. I do not have a problem with either of these. It can get warm on the bottom but not more so than my previous HP chromebook.. I use it off and on through the day for about 6 hrs and still have battery life when I plug it in at night.I use this mainly for web browsing and media consumption. I checked out other models, but kept coming back to the Samsung Galaxy. I am not sure I would pay the full price, but did not hesitate when it went on sale.",0

Battery life is no problem for me, I’m sure I should be away from this device long enough to charge it.Don’t hesitate buy this Samsung Chrome  Book or one built with the same configuration.  Did I mention the screen is the finest screen on any computer available, read about it.  Good bye Windows.",0
"This is a beautiful machine. Solid build, snappy color, great screen, easy to use keys and trackpad. I did my research and knew of possible problems with heat and low battery life. I do not have a problem with either of these. It can get warm on the bottom but not more so than my previous HP chromebook.. I use it off and on through the day for about 6 hrs and still have battery life when I plug it in at night.I use this mainly for web browsing and media consumption. I checked out other models, but kept coming back to the Samsung Galaxy. I am not sure I would pay the full price, but did not hesitate when it went on sale.",1
I loved the quality of the viewing screen,1
Great screen only problem you can't stream 4k movies on the 4k screen,1
"very nice look, thin, everything works quickly on the touch of a finger and on the phone as it is nearby worth buying I recommend",1
My first Chrome book I love it,1
A++,1
"* The left arrow key doesn't reliably connect unless I hit it much harder than I have to hit the other keys.* It's a roll of the dice whether the laptop shuts off or merely sleeps when I close the lid, which means when I re-open it I'm often faced with a full restart, and Chrome has to re-load all my tabs etc. This seems to reset brightness preferences: the screen starts up intolerably dim, for some reason.* Even worse, occasionally when I re-open the laptop it's in this weird state where it seems to think it's on, but the screen is completely black and I have to force a restart. This is both annoying and concerning.* The keyboard is technically backlit, but the light is so dim that it barely helps even when it's dark.* The trackpad is easily pushed down to click near its bottom, but gets increasingly difficult as you go up, which just feels really weird and inconsistent. More than 1/2 of the way up, it's too hard to press for me to practically want to.Despite all the flaws, I love this machine. It's super light. I like the feel of the construction. I like the color. I really like having the browser back/forward/refresh on the keyboard. The stylus, working with Android art programs I already knew and loved, has been a delight. It's really nice to be able to go right from typing an article to drawing illustrations for it on the same device. Being able to run android apps natively on a 2-in-1 is really cool (even though realistically I'd often be better off using the desktop versions of apps on a mac or windows machine -- for example, Slack and Discord do not provide a great experience running their android app in chromos, compared with the experience of their desktop applications on mac. And in other cases, like Webtoons, I'm realistically better off just visiting the webpage. But running the app natively is so cool!).",1
Great!!,1
11 days to import the laptop to Japan.This Chromebook has a fast response time.Touch screen is very easy to use.UHD screen is very beautiful.This is the best Chromebook.,1
"Great device. Battery life is short but I’d expect that with such a slim design and powerful display. The responsiveness of the trackpad and keyboard are great, and I have had no issues with sluggish response times of the OS.If battery life is an issue for you, invest in a 20,000mAh portable battery and you are good to go.",1
"Perfect for my needs.  So light and portable.  And fast.  Love the touchscreen.  And the screen resolution is amazing.  Breaking up with Windows was scary, but no regrets!",1
Even though I purchase numerous items monthly I rarely do reviews but had to say something this time. This was supposedly one of the best chrome books out but It has disappointed me. The screen constantly dims at least 50 percent every 2 to 3 minutes for no apparent reason. Its extremly frustrating. All possible setting configurations have been tried with no success. I purchased it in November but only began using it in January. I dont think I can return so late so I'm stuck with a defective product. Not happy!,1
It works.  But whoever refurbished this left the talking mode active.. And i cant help my 70yr old dad figure out how to turn it off.  It is a most annoying feature.,1
Just got this today.  Works great! No cosmetic damage at all. Has an AUE date of June of 2027. So basically 5 years of automatic updates.,0
This purchase was perfect for me.,1
Served the purpose I bought it for.,1
My Chromebook is a refurbished model but is absolutely like brand new!  I couldn't be happier.,1

"I ordered chromebook for very light use, such as drawing out ideas for art projects and sometimes doing searches for materials and orders without having to be at my desk constantly. It is nice looking, I love the red, I liked that it is aluminum and not plastic. The touch screen isn't up to standards for me. When I am switching between apps swiping up seems to take a few attempts at least. Battery life is horrible! I get about 2 hours out of a full charge, sometimes 2 1/2 hours but never more. Other reviews mentioned the heat factor and that is correct. I decided to take the chance because the heat issue seemed to have mixed opinions but after using this for a little over a month,  the heat transferred from bottom is an issue. It gets VERY hot. No, it hasn't left burn marks on my skin but it gets hot enough to be very uncomfortable. Because of battery life and the heat issue I don't use it much unless I can set it on a small side table or sofa table which is about the same as having to sit at my desk and use my desktop PC. I would not buy this again.",1

"I rated this laptop five stars for a few reasons. I know you are reading this to know if you should buy it. To make it simple, there is a pros and cons list below.Pros:BEAUTIFUL 4k amoled displayfast and responsiveamazing clicky keyboardfingerprint sensor for ease of useresponsive trackpad and while I understand many reviewers say there is not enough vertical real estate there certainly is and I promise you that.Chrome OS is easy to use and has great securitygets extremely brightflips into a tabletcan run geforce games such as fortnitehas tent mods and great for watching netflix and suchload times are very fastone finger liftWhile it does for many it does not overheat for me at allside speakers are much better than ones on the back of the keyboard if you like to keep your laptop on your lap but still not as good as front firing speakers but because of the size I understand while they were unable to do itget access to almost anything in the playstore that supports laptopstext on messages for the webremembers passwords if you wantCons:High priceChrome OS is a con for some but a pro to others(this is not a con for me and any other chromebook user. I am putting this here if you are planning to make a switch from windows or mac. There are many tutorials to help guide you along the way)Overheating for some(not for me)I personally had to return the laptop 2-3 times for a new one because they were defective. It was probably just me though.large bottom bezelthe screen may be too big for some.60hz refresh rate could be a con for someAll in all, this  is clearly the best chromebook over 600 dollars. The beautiful screen, the nice, keyboard, and glass trackpad make it an easy buy. The bottom bezel actually makes the screen look bigger if it was still thirteen inches. If you have the money and a 13 inch screen is enough for you, buy it. If you are used to a 15 inch screen I promise the transition is easy. I went from a 15.5 inch to a 13.3 inch chromebook and it was much easier than expected.Should you buy it(if you have the money): YESOverall score: 9.4/10 (10 is the perfect laptop which will not happen for several years)",0
"It's beautiful and futuristic with its sleek solid built and fantastic screen.  I liked everything about it except for the extreme heat that it developed randomly.  It became so hot that I worried for its internals and it was too hot to be on my lap.That said, had I known there would be such an expensive restocking fee, I would have kept it.  Actually, I would NEVER have bought it from Amazon!  I lost $140.00 to Amazon's restocking fee and I'm still stunned.  I must have missed this fact somewhere in the information.  Expensive lesson learned.",1
"Good looking product, runs great so far!",1
"The machine's design is sleek, video images are sharp and clear, the computer is lightweight, however, the big problem with this computer is that it is extremely buggy, which makes it unreliable if you are trying to get work done.Although the touch screen always seems to work well enough, you will lose many hours of productive time when the trackpad fails and, of course, it always fails at the most inconvenient times.Also, the backlight on the keyboard only works occasionally. There is no telling when it will or will not work. This makes the computer unreliable when it comes to getting work done. But it looks nice.The printed letters and numbers on the keyboard are often difficult to read due to a lack of contrast against the color of the keys. This means that you will occasionally have to squint and turn your head at odd angles to make sure your fingers are properly positioned, and this can slow you down. Moreover, although it is possible to find workarounds for the deficiencies of this machine, the flaws in its design, its hardware, and its software will kill the flow of your creativity.Overall, the item looks nice; it is visually appealing. But its performance... Well, another story.",0
"I got the white screen saying that ""Chrome OS is missing or damaged."" I tried installing chrome again. I restarted it. I called Samsung support and was on the phone for over two hours just for them to tell me that I'll have to send it in. I sent it the next day ($18 just to ship it), and they told me today that it was broken and they would have to send me a replacement. Fingers crossed that it goes well and they'll keep their word.The computer itself is very nice, but the software is buggy. I don't like Apple products but now I'm considering switching over. :(",0
"Screen quality is awesome, light weight and very portable, great built quality, the best Chromebook at this price point or any price point, only downside is battery life compared to other Chromebooks, but not horrible at all for a 4K screen and core i5 processor, this Chromebook will multitask and handle anything you throw at it.",1
"I get the white screen of death daily saying Chrome OS cannot be found.  I've powerwashed, reinstalled the software.  Also the trackpad stops working out of the blue and rebooting the device doesn't fix it.  I suspect it is hardware issues.Also the sofware is sooo buggy.  What is the point in having a fingerprint sensor if the device shuts down every time you close the lid and requires password.  Is that because the device crashed or was that just not thought out.....Linux apps are useless because they freeze the entire device every time I use Android studio.  The only way to resolve is to hold the power button until it reboots.  I'VE ONLY HAD IT FOR TWO WEEKS and I've had this many issues.  Do not buy if you are a power user.  If your not, but a cheep chromebook.",0
"These were a donation for a clinic in the Caribbean for medical record keeping. They are small, but all started and connected to the Internet. As far as I know, they are working well.",1
This computer worked very well for my college needs. Writing papers and checking the internet were a breeze!,1
"I love this Chromebook. Very very well made. Excellent quality and sound. Great connections. Love the pen and the precision of the touchscreen. I do not like that I can't have the full desktop version of Firefox, but Chrome does a good job. Not all google play apps run smoothly some crash and it is almost impossible to run them. Google needs to work with the developers to make Chromebook specific apps, otherwise this is going to be trouble. I love that it has more than one thunderbolt connection. I have a ethernet to thunderbolt adapter and the internet goes twice as fast vs wifi and I have a premium mesh system, so this is great, because I am not a fan of wifi. The battery lasts some 4 - 5 hours, that is the only drawback. But the rest is great. I just use for personal basic apps. No fancy games here. But have not had any problems with running multiple apps.",0
Love it!,1
I bought this for my brother for school. I booted it up and there were lines on the screen that weren't supposed to be there. When a window pops up it started flashing. Definitely a defective refurbished item. I cannot take a picture since I've already packaged up for a return. The packaging was good. Item was not as described.,1
"The equiptment arrived as posted,nicely packaged. As,of this date7/25 the chromebook is doing it's thing without any glitches. I have no problems to date so,I can't comment on the seller but I am sure they will handle any problems that I might have.",1
"First of all let's start with the design which is unbelievable. Being able to come up with such a powerful device so thin and light, just sets the bar on what is possible.Nevertheless it is still a Chromebook/Android tablet/2 in 1. Superfast on everything web-related, secure, beautiful screen and Android apps support make it ideal for most use cases if not a bit of an overkill.But if one needs tasks like video/photo editing, desktop Office apps etc, other solutions may be more suitable for the price.",0
Top of laptop is very scratched and in poor condition!,1
"This is a beautiful little Chromebook. It is light, with a high resolution screen, and a nice keyboard. Unfortunately, it is unreliable. I got one about a month ago. Several times a day it crashed. It stopped while I was working, or when I opened the top to turn it back on, it had crashed back to the sign-on screen with a message: ""Chrome didn't shut down correctly."" It also hung up, refusing to turn on until you held the power key for 20 seconds. Also, it did not work with the wi-fi extender. A ""powerwash"" reset did not help.Amazon gave me a replacement unit with no argument. It arrived yesterday. Yesterday it crashed once, and hung up once. Today it crashed again. Modern computer equipment is reliable so this is unusual. I do not think it is a coincidence that two out of two are unreliable.In my opinion, the designers put too much effort into strange features such as the stylus, and a non-working fingerprint detection key. (I finally got it to register after several attempts, but it does not sign on to anything.) They should have made it more reliable instead.I will probably keep it, because a Chromebook is more of a glorified i-Pad more than it is a computer. As long as you can browse, it is okay, even if it crashes unexpectedly. It has various applications such as word processing, but they are all the Google on-line versions, so you do not lose your work when it crashes. I will keep this one, but I would not recommend it to anyone.I recommend Chromebooks in general. For my purposes they are much better than laptop computers. I had another one for many years, from another maker. It never had problems like this. It finally died of old age, but it was reliable for a long time.FOLLOW UP: The replacement unit crashed 5 times in one day, so I returned it for a refund. Again, Amazon did not give me any trouble. They suggested I contact Samsung and tell them I had problems with two units. The woman at Samsung said, ""we have not heard of any problems like that."" I told her to come here to Amazon and read these reviews. I have a feeling that someone in their organization is not letting the bad news about this product spread through the company.",1
"Had to go through 3 devices to finally get one that was properly built, as Samsung's quality control is really hit or miss, especially for this device for some reason, so you're basically playing the lottery. Luckily, Amazon's customer service is one of the best in the industry so I was able to get one that functioned properly and was assembled correctly. As far as how it performs, you won't be disappointed, I view this as more of a leisure device opposed to productivity, so far that use case it really is a treat. The screen is gorgeous, blacks are actually black, contrast is through the roof, and colors are so vibrant and full of life that you'll struggle going back to regular screens. The build quality(when you get a good unit) is great, very premium and sturdy, while still being very lightweight. It feels really nice in the hands, and it has the benefit of being just as nice to use as it is to look at. Seriously this is one of the most beautiful computers out there, not just for a chromebook, the metallic cherry red just pops and the silver chrome edges are such a nice touch, it really is a shame that Samsung doesn't offer this color scheme in any other device, I'd love to see it on a windows laptop for example, and like won't ever. All in all, this is a rather expensive chromebook, you're definitely paying a premium for this device, but if you're looking for a great screen, beautiful design, in a premium lightweight chassis, that functions as a tablet replacement of sorts, then this is the chromebook for you.",1
"Haven't used only tested it, been in case",0
"Beautiful red color, great computer!",0
"The screen quality is absolutely amazing, the whole design is slick and nice. Its also very light. Also, this chromebook is easy to use and manage. I have nothing negative to say about my purchase. Its worth the price you spend!",1
"TL;DR great computer with cool features but compromised battery for thinness. The first thing I have to say is that the screen quality is superb and paired with tablet mode is a defiant win in my book. The s pen is muchmore functional on a Note 20 ultra than a computer, it is a cool gimmick and makes presentations easier because of the red dot feature. The i5 is a medium stage processor, I was going to buy a dell with an i7 but decided that the i5 was good enough, the thinness is also extremely convenient having a decent computer without added weight. There are a few cons though, the battery life is comparable to the note 20 ultra running full boar. This computer also only runs chrome which can be a downside to some but not to me. The c charger on both sides is one of the best parts of this computer because now I only need the fast charger it came with to charge my phone, computer, or headphones. The lighted keyboard makes a big difference in the dark and the camera near the keyboard made to take photos in tablet mode is cool because it looks like a big note 20. It also says on streaming services that it is running 8k but the screen is only capable of 4k. Overall this is a good student computer and worth the money, but if you need the windows just buy the new galaxy book pro. 6.9inch note 20 ultra for scale, 1:1 scale on both s pens. Viewing screen size is the same as the note 20 ultra, about 1.5 the size of an s8+ of note 20 ultra thickness wise. This thing is phone thin. Samsung has yet to fail me.",0
Love it,1
This is one of the best items I have ever purchased from Amazon. This Chromebook was basically new without one single scratch or blemish. The price was fair I am very glad I pulled the trigger and will recommend this seller to my huge network. Thank you!,1
"I needed a lightweight laptop for handling basic tasks when traveling. This is perfect. I'm a lifelong Samsung and Google user, I barely know anything else, so this was fully in my comfort zone.Don't expect a lot of bells and whistles; that's not what a chromebook is for. This is a basic secondary laptop or a good starter computer. Not for anything complicated.Still, I think it's very useful.",1

This is a basic secondary laptop or a good starter computer. Not for anything complicated.Still, I think it's very useful.",1
"A good place to start would be that I got this chromebook at a discount ($749, down from $999). And my needs are mainly to run Citrix (through browser or Chrome app, either works) for work and to casually browse, read magazines/books or listen to Spotify.  Not a ""Power User"" by any means, though not sure any Chrome OS user is.That being said, this is THE BEST CHROMEBOOK I'VE EVER USED, and it is more than perfect to suit my needs.Build: The thing is beautiful, a really premium feel to the materials, and the red is really classy and not too gaudy as I was a bit worried and almost went with the more drab grey option - I'm glad I didn't. The chrome ring around the outside is also a premium touch that looks great. It's the thinnest and lightest 2-in-1 laptop I've ever seen, and I know that I like to use 2-in-1s in tablet mode and this is the first time it actually feels comfortable and feasible to do that for more than a brief period of time. The 2.2lbs was a big draw for me when comparing this laptop to the Galaxy Chromebook 2, Asus C436, or the Acer Spin 713 - upon using it I am glad I took it into consideration. Other great things about the build are the relatively loud stereo speakers and the built-in stylus. Minor drawbacks would be the weak hinge that doesn't always hold the screen in place when moving the laptop if open (though for the most part it does the job) and the lack of ports (you just get 2 USB-C ports, which also function as charging ports, so if you're charging you only have 1...adapters easily solve this). Also the cameras are weak but I don't use those - if you're buying for camera quality only for some reason (Zoom?) then this isn't the one for you.Screen: The SCREEN is AMAZING. The OLED is top notch and better than any Chromebook I've ever seen, at full brightness the colors are insane. That being said, the high resolution and the brightness eat at the battery life a lot, so in most cases I've got brightness scaled way down and I don't really miss anything, it works fine. Touch works perfectly, the stylus allows for really detailed notes/drawings in Canva or other apps. One drawback might be the bezel placement, there are 3 super-thin outer bezels and one larger bottom bezel... in tablet mode that one larger bezel functions well as a ""handle"" of sorts, but the other sides can't be touched without accidentally hitting the screen and scrolling or clicking a link, etc. A very minor nuisance at most. Another minor issue is that the resolution is SO GOOD that when I run Citrix, the session almost appears blurry, but still workable - on high resolution windows machines Citrix has addressed this with DPI scaling, but they've yet to master this on the Chrome OS app or the Chrome web app. Not Samsung's issue, but still part of my experience with the machine so I thought it worth mentioning.Performance: This thing is a BEAST. There's arguably no need for an Intel i5 in a Chromebook, but here we are, and the thing is FAST. Scrolling is smooth and even with tons of tabs open I've never experienced lag when playing videos or games. With lots going on under the hood, and no fan, I've heard mention from others that the computer can get really hot under heavy loads - I've barely experienced this while using a decent amount of processing power, and would elaborate that when I did feel heat it was very minor and not unbearable by any means. I'm thinking unless you are gaming a lot or developing in linux or doing something really really processor heavy, you'll be fine. A small performance gripe in general is that Android apps don't always play well with Chrome OS and have re-sizing issues or some lag, but this is not a Samsung problem, more of a Google problem.Battery Life: Some people have called this the achilles heel of the laptop, but I don't have much issue. Again, I'm not a real gamer/developer/super user - I am Joe Basic using it for administrative work and browsing/music/reading. On an average day at like 70% brightness I can unplug at 8am and make it to about 3 or 4pm before having to plug back in while working in Citrix doing basic tasks on MS Access, Excel, etc - nothing intense but that's pretty much constant screentime for about 6-7 hours before it starts getting low and I've got to plug in. Obviously this is not great in comparison to 10+ hours at full brightness seen on other Chromebooks - but you are getting more than the average Chromebook here and this is a bit of a concession made on Samsung's part to provide the rest of the goods. Overall if you don't need to be away from a charger for more than 6 hours every day, you shouldn't have an issue.Should you buy it: If you have read this far and think your needs/usage are similar to mine and you want the sleek-est, coolest, thinnest chromebook out there, DEFINITELY BUY THIS (especially if on discount, which it frequently is between Amazon, Best Buy, and Samdsung's own site).",1

"So, I took a wild chance on this because the price was so low and it was refurbished.  I am replacing a Chromebook in which the AUE (automatic update expiration) date was June of 2022.  I asked the question about this Samsung's AUE and I received no response.  I figured I would buy and just return it if it was unsatisfactory.  After power-up the first thing I did was check the AUE in settings and discovered that it wasn't until JUNE of 2027!!!  That's great news.If you don't know what AUE is and you are buying a chromebook you should probably do some research on this before you make a purchase.  Amazon is literally selling chromebooks with as little as 3 months left until AUE... These are units that did not qualify for the google one-year extension.Anyways, besides the AUE I have tested the sound, screen, keypad... ALL GOOD.  It's obvious that it has been slightly USED, but who cares at the price point.The only remaining test is the battery.  If I can get 4-5 hours out of a full charge that will satisfy my needs.",0

Each one included a factory USB C charge cable and block.I was pleasantly surprised at the condition of the computers. They all looked BRAND NEW. Only one even has a mark and I wiped that mark off with my finger.I booted each one up and attached the charger to ensure they would charge and they did. Each one booted and found our WiFi perfectly.This Chromebooks look and function as new. The kids have been using them for school for a couple days now and have zero issues with them at all.",1
"The screen on this computer is truly beautiful. The difference that an amoled makes really is worth the extra money but be warned that netflix and google play will not allow you to watch content in anything higher than 720p and 420p respectively.I found this out last night when trying to buy black panther on google play to watch in HD. It would not play in anything more than 420p!When watching normal - not payed for - YouTube you can watch in 4k and the screen looks truly stunning. The quality in places is so high it feels 3D.The battery life leaves something to be desired. For me it is just over 3 hours. This can vary widely depending on what you are watching. When working on code in a terminal, the amoled showing black allows the battery to last a lot longer. The issue comes from trying to run a 4k screen, doing so requires a lot more computation which makes it all the more of a shame that 4k content is particularly scarce.The stylus works incredibly well, writing on this is a dream.I bought this for the amoled screen and chrome os and the issues with battery and 4k content are frustraiting but for me at least do not detract from how lovely the machine is to use.",1

I bought it for writing and doing small bits and pieces of editing and it has really worked out well. Another reason I bought this is because I looove going to coffee shops to read and such. Now I can go get coffee and write too! It's a really nice computer that seems to be up to date and will stay that way for awhile. :)",1

"Bought for my kids homeschooling , works great doesn’t lag haven’t had any problems and it’s almost Christmas already and my 13yo didn’t break it yet so it must be decent 👍",1
"This is an excellent computer. I had one before that was defective and this was a replacement. It's really well made of solid machined aluminum and very attractive in the ""fiesta red"" color. Battery life is good depending on usage of course but I do get all-day mixed use of 6-8 hours of screen time. The screen is a beauty and the general performance is more than adequate; speedy reactions to input with rarely any lag at all. I got this as an alternative to a windows computer because I felt like I really didn't need all those capabilities with my typical use. I haven't found anything to complain about and I am quite happy with this purchase.",0
"For the limited time I have used this unit I am impressed. No concerns with having purchased a renewed unit. My needs for a laptop are fulfilled to the degree that if this unit functions well over a respectable time period, it will eliminate the need to replace my current unit (and more expensive) that features that are simply never utilized. Only drawback at this time is the smaller screen compared to my laptop currently used.",1
"Honestly this Is the best laptop Ive ever owned, the OLED screen is just gorgeous, also this computer is just 0.4 inch thin, just like the Acer Swift 7, the processor is very snappy, transfers files greatly due to its solid technology SSD. Chrome OS has a great user experience and I've replaces Microsoft with Google Docs. A great thing is the trackpad gestures and being able to create virtual desktops. Also Chrome OS has great connectivity, I am running a logitech BRIO webcam, my MX Keys, mouse and I am about to but a trackpad from apple. Battery runa for five hours and I don't care",0
I like everything,1
"Having owned this Chromebook for over a year and using it primarily as a touch-screen tablet with a keyboard, I'm overall fairly satisfied.  The beautiful red solid aluminum body and stunning AMOLED touch-screen are the stars of this show.  Unfortunately, there's an unfortunate detraction in the form of the trackpad sometimes freezing up and I believe it's due to the machine running too hot.  Shutting the machine down and letting it cool down fixes the issue.  A more practical workaround is using a cooling pad or pairing a mouse to keep working when the trackpad isn't.  For my use case, I can live with the issue as I really enjoy viewing photographs or videos on such an amazing display but your mileage will vary.",1
"I’ve never purchased a chrome book before but I’m so thrilled that I did. This is perfect for my needs of using the internet, writing stories, keeping in contact with friends and family and for the price it’s such an incredible purchase.",1
Didn’t specify that this product is refurbished…,1
"I have like 5 days with my Chromebook and I have to say I replaced a brand new Lenovo Duet from March 2021 so, it was my first trial with ChromeOS and I loved it! Besides the OS, eventough Lenovo's equipment is a terrific equipment and value for the price and performs well for its segment, I wanted something more powerful because I use 70% for work and 30% personal matter. And I'm using my Samsung instead my work's Dell Latitude with latest core i7 vPro 16 GB RAM, the issue is portability and it uses 70% if its power in security stuff loaded by my company. And I gotta say Samsung Galaxy Chromebook performs waaay better.Everything in it it's perfect and as many almost all know, battery is an ""issue"" because does to last as long as regular Chromebooks but man, consider, the amazing 13.3 in 4K AMOLED screen takes its part of the juice, also the i5 processor if you demand for power but at the end, nothing to worry about if you reduce screen brigthness and have moderate usage. I was concerned about that but know I realize it is not the issue many say.I know I just jumped from top of bottom segment to top of top and belive me, once you do, there's no turning back. Fortunately there's a lot of more affordable options with great specs and just little more dimensions.",1
"Beautiful red color, great computer!",1
Very light.  Good screen quality.,1
So far so good. Easy set-up. Not too much verification to walk thru. Nice and light. Easy hook-up of a port with the wireless mouse device. It will take some time for me to get used to the programming as I've only lived in a Windows world. One thing I have to get used to is all the banner & pop-up ads. Another thing to be careful of is the type of cover if you want one. I'm opting for a bag as I had to return the cover because it didn't fit.,1
"Yup, after exhaustive research I purchased the Intel I-5 version.  So far no complaints .. Screen quality, sound, keyboard, touch screen, battery life and camera ... excellent. Trust me, I've built desktop computers from parts for video editing, I play on-line games on my gaming laptop, and since it was purchased for my wife; no even one ""honey how do you do this?""",1
Only issue which isn't a Samsung issue it's a Chromebook issues is the mousepad occasionally going unresponsive because of dust or something else. Just close the lid and open it back up and it works again almost always on the first try sometimes/rarely it takes a second close and open.,1
"This Samsung Chromebook arrived in a tattered box for a Lenovo Chromebook. Upon unboxing, I found they boxed it up with NO POWER ADAPTER OR PLUG-IN WALL SOCKET ADAPTER. Amazon issued me a credit that allowed me to get a power supply and cable locally. Once I plugged it in, I discovered it could NOT READ AN SD CARD. Essentially, the port was not functioning. It's going back as a return. I ran several apps and found the machine hung, as in froze. As for cosmetics, the screen had lots of greasy smudges on it, and the outer case was grimey and needed wiping down. All in all, I've received better stuff from eBay than this piece of nonsense. I think rather than sell these as recertificied, it would be more accurate to call them RECYCLED. It appeared as though the thing had merely been reboxed and sent back out. I neither recommend any recertified anything from this merchant or Amazon. This was junk in a box.",1

"So, I took a wild chance on this because the price was so low and it was refurbished.  I am replacing a Chromebook in which the AUE (automatic update expiration) date was June of 2022.  I asked the question about this Samsung's AUE and I received no response.  I figured I would buy and just return it if it was unsatisfactory.  After power-up the first thing I did was check the AUE in settings and discovered that it wasn't until JUNE of 2027!!!  That's great news.If you don't know what AUE is and you are buying a chromebook you should probably do some research on this before you make a purchase.  Amazon is literally selling chromebooks with as little as 3 months left until AUE... These are units that did not qualify for the google one-year extension.Anyways, besides the AUE I have tested the sound, screen, keypad... ALL GOOD.  It's obvious that it has been slightly USED, but who cares at the price point.The only remaining test is the battery.  If I can get 4-5 hours out of a full charge that will satisfy my needs.",1
I absolutely love this computer. I  watch all the videos and TV shows on this computer.,0
What I dislike About That Chromebook it had internet issues,1
"I haven't had the computer long enough to test it's durability, but for right now, it's just what the doctor ordered.",1
"Just got this little thing! Not bad. Great value for the price. After reading the reviews before I got this, I wasn't sure about the function/battery life issues I read in the reviews. I have had NO issues. Works great just like it's supposed to (so far). I'll give it a few months and maybe do another review, but for now, I'd give this refurbished Chrome-Book an ""4.8"" overall. (You may want to go with the larger screen display).",1
Definitely does the job- we have it as our shop computer. But always have CONSTANT connectivity issues with the internet. Screen is fairly small but it works. This has 100% no bells and whistles. More or less a netbook.,1
"Product had to be returned as it froze up, we just got another refurbished one. Hopefully this one lasts longer than a few weeks.",1
I absolutely love this computer. I  watch all the videos and TV shows on this computer.,1

Looks great and the screen is absolutely  beautiful!,0
"Fast repair, mailed out quick. Good laptop",1
"Not capable to window,  no OS.",1
"Very pleased. Long battery life. Good enough picture quality and screen size to make personal viewing of movies and videos pleasurable. Slim. Sturdy. Keyboard adequate size for my clumsy, fat fingers. Love it.",1
"I rated this laptop five stars for a few reasons. I know you are reading this to know if you should buy it. To make it simple, there is a pros and cons list below.Pros:BEAUTIFUL 4k amoled displayfast and responsiveamazing clicky keyboardfingerprint sensor for ease of useresponsive trackpad and while I understand many reviewers say there is not enough vertical real estate there certainly is and I promise you that.Chrome OS is easy to use and has great securitygets extremely brightflips into a tabletcan run geforce games such as fortnitehas tent mods and great for watching netflix and suchload times are very fastone finger liftWhile it does for many it does not overheat for me at allside speakers are much better than ones on the back of the keyboard if you like to keep your laptop on your lap but still not as good as front firing speakers but because of the size I understand while they were unable to do itget access to almost anything in the playstore that supports laptopstext on messages for the webremembers passwords if you wantCons:High priceChrome OS is a con for some but a pro to others(this is not a con for me and any other chromebook user. I am putting this here if you are planning to make a switch from windows or mac. There are many tutorials to help guide you along the way)Overheating for some(not for me)I personally had to return the laptop 2-3 times for a new one because they were defective. It was probably just me though.large bottom bezelthe screen may be too big for some.60hz refresh rate could be a con for someAll in all, this  is clearly the best chromebook over 600 dollars. The beautiful screen, the nice, keyboard, and glass trackpad make it an easy buy. The bottom bezel actually makes the screen look bigger if it was still thirteen inches. If you have the money and a 13 inch screen is enough for you, buy it. If you are used to a 15 inch screen I promise the transition is easy. I went from a 15.5 inch to a 13.3 inch chromebook and it was much easier than expected.Should you buy it(if you have the money): YESOverall score: 9.4/10 (10 is the perfect laptop which will not happen for several years)",1
"I had very gracefully tripped over the power cable on my old Chromebook. Fortunately the only thing I broke was not my knees, but the screen on my computer. 24 hours later I had this replacement in my home set up and running.Nice little machine. Perfectly clean and functional; you'd never know it was not brand new. It was packed very professionally and shipped out immediately. Talk about caring for the customer! Wow. And the price fit my budget. I'd gladly buy from this seller again.",1
"Thin, lightweight, crystal clear screen, incredibly easy to navigate I could not be any happier.  However, I would never do business with this reseller ever again. No where does it state that you will pay a 20% restocking fee, very deceptive business practices.",1
Overall this laptop is a good investment. Easy to set up. A bit small but great quality product.,1
"We ordered four so our kids could use the play store to be able to access the new Teaching Textbooks 4.0 app, and they meet that need.They came in generic laptop boxes and were packaged very well for shipping. Each one included a factory USB C charge cable and block.I was pleasantly surprised at the condition of the computers. They all looked BRAND NEW. Only one even has a mark and I wiped that mark off with my finger.I booted each one up and attached the charger to ensure they would charge and they did. Each one booted and found our WiFi perfectly.This Chromebooks look and function as new. The kids have been using them for school for a couple days now and have zero issues with them at all.",1
Still sensitive with the touch screen,1
Maravilhoso,1
"I returned this computer. Wanted to love it; beautiful form factor, very lightweight, great touchpad, great 2 in 1 functionality. That's all the Pros.Cons:The keyboard was red making it super hard to see the characters on the keys. Usually doesn't matter but sometimes it really does.Battery got so hot it burned my leg through jeans causing redness that lasted about 24 hoursThe screen seemed to dim and brighten constantly until I realized it was a function of my head position in that the SLIGHTEST movement of my head brought my eyes out of optimal viewing angle. Got a neck ache trying to stay at the perfect angle.Incredibly bad battery life. Starting at 96% I steamed a 44 minute episode from Netflix, read 3 articles with ads but no video with two tabs open and was left with 43% charge after 90 minutes. Then I closed all but one tab and left the laptop open and 'asleep' for 3 hours after which only 6% battery life remained. So 90% of battery life was drained in 4.5 hours with minimal to no usage. That's basically broken as far as I'm concerned. I replace my older, much cheaper, Chromebooks when the battery life gets that bad. Usually takes 4 years or more for that to happen.",1
The battery failed to hold a charge after only 4 days after the purchase.,1
"I do not recommend. The screen is dull and it has several dead keys (including the right shift key, comma key.) I tried ""support"" and the person couldn't provide simple instructions for the steps they wanted me to provide. In fact they were giving me instructions for a Windows OS.Really disappointed with this purchase. It's getting returned tomorrow. This was obviously not inspected or serviced before being resold.",1
"I had this not even one day, but have to say I was impressed with it. I ordered it to hold me till I got my laptop but as it has it I just scored one laptop and a computer so need to send back!  But great little machine!",0
"Its sad my daughter bought this with her first check this year.... it worked well for awhile then all of sudden it doesnt charge anymore.  I contacted Amazon it was a 90 day warranty.  I was told to contact the seller, there is no contact information.  She only had it for six months now, its sad Amazon will not help her and the company make sure you will not be able to contact them if anything goes wrong.  Bad Customer Service!",1
Great little computer to fit in my work locker. To watch iTunes on lunch. Screen could have been sooo much better but the speakers are great. Chromebook doesn’t allow for the Bluetooth controller I bought but I’ve been told to try a wireless Xbox one controller. It actually runs gba emulation too.,1
 I'm hugely disappointed,1

Just got this today.  Works great! No cosmetic damage at all. Has an AUE date of June of 2027. So basically 5 years of automatic updates.,1
"I get the white screen of death daily saying Chrome OS cannot be found.  I've powerwashed, reinstalled the software.  Also the trackpad stops working out of the blue and rebooting the device doesn't fix it.  I suspect it is hardware issues.Also the sofware is sooo buggy.  What is the point in having a fingerprint sensor if the device shuts down every time you close the lid and requires password.  Is that because the device crashed or was that just not thought out.....Linux apps are useless because they freeze the entire device every time I use Android studio.  The only way to resolve is to hold the power button until it reboots.  I'VE ONLY HAD IT FOR TWO WEEKS and I've had this many issues.  Do not buy if you are a power user.  If your not, but a cheep chromebook.",1
"Great device. Battery life is short but I’d expect that with such a slim design and powerful display. The responsiveness of the trackpad and keyboard are great, and I have had no issues with sluggish response times of the OS.If battery life is an issue for you, invest in a 20,000mAh portable battery and you are good to go.",0
"Home use, size screen is good.. 62 years young and easy to use.",1
I guess you can order a good-as-new laptop for ninety bucks. What a time to be alive,0
"Know what you're getting into beforehand, manage your expectations, and you should be pleasantly surprised. I couldn't find so much as a fingerprint on it. It wasn't in the original packaging but it didn't matter. Very pleased.",1
"Early impressions - Impossibly thin. Android apps are surprisingly better than web app variants. Red is the laptop color I never knew I needed. The keyboard travel and ""thud"" is satisfying and the trackpad is Apple level.Like every other review, the battery is abysmal compared to any ultrabook in 2020 (3-4 hours max with comfortable brightness). However, this is the best home laptop you can get right now. The design is hard to appreciate until it's in your hands, but I have never seen a thinner device with an i5 chip. It gets warm without a fan but nothing uncomfortable. The pen performs better than the gen 1 Apple Pencil I'm coming off of. I can't say this is great for art, but you get access to Concepts in the Play store and Adobe Draw. I do wish Samsung Notes was an option given the Galaxy name, but here we are. Big, big fan of using my mobile only fantasy football app (Sleeper) on a bigger screen. Most Android apps I've installed are responsive which helps to avoid going fullscreen/forced to use the touchscreen in portrait.Connecting a Dualshock4 controller was effortless, didn't need to configure for Among Us either. Some games like Shadowfall will need some effort to work. No CoD Mobile support was a bummer, hopefully in an update.Complaints: The screen looks great, however no 4k support on most streaming options AND due to the OLED this screen is very dim by default. If you have it at 50% your eyes will be strained after an hour. 70% is comfortable, getting 4 hours average.If you're looking to continue your Android experience in laptop form, this is the way.",0

"Bought this Chromebook because it was decently priced (under $600), didn't have a Celeron, was thin and wanted to try my hand at something that wasn't Windows based.Took a bit of time figuring out how to navigate and am kind of still learning but this laptop is very appealing for what I was wanting to use it for. It's the only Chromebook I know with a 4k resolution screen, not that I was wanting it for that, but the image quality looks stunning. The i-5 processor is fast enough to handle most any daily functions and the thin stylings of the laptop itself is very appealing. It comes with a stylus that's installed directly into the machine and works flawlessly. Audio isn't anything to brag about but does get plenty loud for most entertainment options. I normally use it to watch a sports game while playing board games with friends or watching Youtube videos to learn said board games. Convertible mode is exactly what you'd expect but was surprised the laptop doesn't get extremely hot when the screen is folded to block the air vents. Is small and light enough that it doesn't seem so burdensome but large enough that it doesn't feel like I'm typing on something meant for a child.My biggest issue though is the 4k screen. I can watch all forms of resolution on this laptop but have no options to force the resolution to something lower to help save on battery life and boy is the 4k screen a energy hog. My entire view point before buying this was that I knew the battery life wasn't that great but figured I'd just lower the resolution and get whatever I could out of the battery but was disappointed to find out that's impossible. Don't get me wrong the 4k screen is beyond beautiful but now I need to plan accordingly if I'll be out and about with this Chromebook, something I didn't really expect when purchasing the product.All in all I'm happy with this product and as long as the battery life isn't a complete deal breaker then I highly recommend.",1
"once i found out how to do it it synced all my old Chromebook info to new, very happy with product",0
"I'd definitely buy this notebook again. And not only because it's the most fancy chromebook on the market. But also because ...It's super thin, super lightweight. Yet it feels sturdy and well built. It's hard to spot any piece of plastic on this notebook.The orange-red color is just beautiful. It's not anything near a sharp or aggressive orange. It's a super warm, slightly metallic color. Truly particular. It sits beautifully on wooden desks as well as on any more office-like desk surface. The color tone changes slightly with the light.It has an exchangeable SSD. Not an (slower) eMMC, and neither is it a non-replaceable chip. Whoever had to trash an entire notebook just because the SSD or eMMC failed, knows that having this unit replaceable matters. Also financially.The keyboard feels great. What a masterpiece of engineering. I mean, the whole lower part of the notebook is barely 6mm thick.Not to talk about the display. It probably outperforms most others on the market (and particularly at this price point).What they talk about in reviews, negatively:- short battery life. Indeed. 4-6hrs. That's few. But if they'd asked me to increase battery life and weight and size or leave it at it is, I'd opted for as it is. I just don't need more than 4-6 hrs of battery life; there's always a plug somewhere.- shaking display: true – when used on the lap while sitting on the sofa. When the notebook sits on a stable surface, like a desk, the hinges hold the display in place and it won't shake.What they don't talk about and what I personally find is a shortcoming:- the quality of sound from the internal speakers is low and I cannot enjoy it for all the video conferences we are having nowadays.Some people ask, why someone would need such a powerful chromebook. Because google understood the cloud, because there's no need for servicing, updating, IT people for your (small) business company. Because it's productivity focused. And because, yes, I literally have about 100 tabs open all the time, on different virtual screens, and sometimes even two accounts logged in, and it is still fast.",1
"context: I bricked my pixelbook i7, 16GB. I also have a Dell XPS 13 i7 32GB.Pros: The Samsung Galaxy chromebook has the best keyboard, best tablet mode experience (on par w/ pixelbook); best pen, IMO (lag free in most cases); great screen. Chrome OS has become a very powerful OS, with Linux, android and phone controls.Battery: Better than expected. I get 6+hrs normally, and everything is blazingly fast, until I do a zoom call... then it gets burning hot and when using a whiteboard app, it starts to lag. However, google meet and other video calls work great, without heating up. I'm a scientist, mostly using it to write/read papers, run some python (locally and ssh), listen to music etc.Other Cons: gets hot on zoom calls; 8GB not enough for chromebooks anymore. Technical: Chrome Os does a good job managing memory and I haven't had issues, but htop in dev mode linux shows 6gb is filled up from startup (mostly due to Android) and I routinely see 7/11 gb of swap memory is filled.",1
"The equiptment arrived as posted,nicely packaged. As,of this date7/25 the chromebook is doing it's thing without any glitches. I have no problems to date so,I can't comment on the seller but I am sure they will handle any problems that I might have.",1
"This is a review that I am going to try to keep brief, but I might fail. Here's why: The Samsung Galaxy Chromebook has had some of the most unfair reviews I have ever read about an inanimate object, and I'd like to clear the air of some of those comments.Let's start with the only thing I agree with from so many negative reviews, and that agreement is 'somewhat' at best, and that's the fact that the battery life is not all that great. Some would say it is terrible, I would say that is true if only going by specs alone. But, in real-life usage by a couch potato like myself, is a minor inconvenience. Why? Well, because I do not use my Chromebook in a manner that requires I run on battery power more than 3 or four hours at a time. If after something between 3 and 5 hours, I get low on battery I do what I have always done... I plug it in! I am not being silly, but serious. I plug it in and keep going for a while, then I unplug it and keep going some more.YES, I could not do that in the forest, at the beach, or on a long flight. But my use case does not require that any longer, like it did when I was an executive in the computer business, taking long flights.SO, if your use case or use model allows plugging in now and then, and 3-plus hours will get you what you need and you can plugin for a while at that point, THAT is what real-world usage is like for many many users of this machine.Next, and last, on the agreed-to complaints list of other reviews is that, yes, the machine does heat up sometimes, but no differently than does my $3500 Apple MacBook Pro every now and then. There isn't a lot to say about that, other than it is not constant nor always-so but does occur about as often and gets about as warm, as my Mac laptops have occasionally become.These two main points are in agreement with similar points on other reviews. But many, if not most, of the other points on clearly negative reviews, are less than objective or real-world, in my opinion.For example, I read a review that said the glass screen was so thin if was prone to break, and that the trackpad was just too small, that the hinges were terrible, that the keyboard was terrible, and on and on. All of which is categorically false, and is not a realistic appraisal of the machine, especially when compared with other very high-end laptops, such as some Apple models, some other high-end Chromebooks such as those from Samsung and Google's own offerings.Now... for the sweet sauce, the good points about this amazingly cool little machine... read on.This machine is thin... really thin. So much so, that for the 1st few days I found myself handling it like the newborn baby it was, but soon I reverted to treating it like a laptop computer. All to say this thing is built really well, AND that it is a top-tier piece of precision electronics like a high-end camera or sophisticated medical device. But while it is not unduly delicate, it does deserve a degree of understanding that it is not a 1-inch thick block of ABS plastic, so use and treat it accordingly.Next, the hinges, no complaints from me. Some reviewers claim they are lousy because the lid/screen will oscillate a bit when adjusted. True. And so does every really thin lid machine I have ever owned. Bu tin the real world, we don't do that, do we? We adjust the screen position and carefully, and it stays put.Next, the keyboard, it is every bit as good, and perhaps better than the keys on any Mac portable I've used for the past 5 plus years, in fact, I think it is a little bit better because the key-travel feels a little bit longer, which can make for better feedback and improved speed.No need to comment on the display, it's simply about as good as it can be. Literally. I don't think you can get a better screen on any laptop today. And many of the reviewers panned the machine because of a lack of 4K video material to consume. Someone should tell them it isn't the machine's issue, is it?Sound. The sound is fine, again, consider what you just purchased, it is not a Bose foldback bass design with an array of 6 drivers for sound. It is an amazingly thin laptop, and it sounds just fine. Does it get loud enough? Yes. Does it get really really really loud? No.The hinges are fine, too. My only complaint is that when fully opened into tablet-style, the lid doesn't lock into place, and my copy floated about 1/8th of an inch above the base unit when handheld at an angle. When in tablet configuration and laying flat, as on a desk or table, the lid was flush as it should be. A little annoying at most.All the great features you've read about are absolutely true of this machine. It is simply the best laptop I have ever owned. In terms of the build detail, it meets, and actually, IMPO surpasses, many if not all major laptop manufacturers' latest designs, especially in the Chromebook marketplace, where this machine may be the best, again, depending on your individual feature, functions, and use-case needs.Performance-wise the included i5 10th generation Clearlake U chipset seems to me to outperform or minimally to keep up with my 2015 Google Pixel Chromebook which used an i7 2.6Ghz processor married to 16GB of RAM. This machine I am reviewing has a chip that moves along at 1.6Ghz and throttles up to 3.9 (some spec sheets rate it above 4.x Ghz) and as such I have had zero performance issues even though it has 8 GB of RAM. So performance-wise, I am very pleased.Would I have been happy if I'd spent $1,000 (actually $999) on this machine? Well, my 2015 machined aluminum, best of breed, Google Pixel Chromebook (the second release in that brand/line) cost me over $1,200 when new, and I never looked back. This machine was discounted to $799 a year ago, and now that it is replaced with the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2, this original Galaxy Chromebook can be had for $599 new while inventory supplies are available. At that price, I would replace it in a micro-second if mine was damaged or lost.Those of us who have been Chromium OS and Chromebook pioneers have been rewarded with an ever increase of Chromebook capabilities in both the hardware and the apps and operating system. This machine, the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook (original version) is a real winner in every way, and while battery life is not top-of-class, this reviewer asserts that pretty much everything else is, and for $600, I am very happy with my purchase.I hope this review has been helpful, regardless of what you end up purchasing when shopping for your next Chromebook computer.",1
"Just what I expected but cheaper as a refurbished products. Small few scratches but small enough not to be bothersome. I love the battery life but as expected the screen is not exquisite as in previous version. The device has a fast processor, quick to start, enough memory to handle multiple projects/apps/tabs.",1
"Better than I thought any Chromebook could be. We are an apple family but IOS is problematic with google classroom. And the Chromebooks they give the students at school really are not built for the heavy use (kinda cheap) This Chromebook is a lot of fun and packed with high-end features, that said it costs $1000 so it better be good!",0
"The laptop is pretty to look at and it's thin. The screen is a really nice quality but doesn't outshine a MacBook but maybe a little better than the pixelbool. When you use it as a tablet it doesn't close fully so it's floppy and you can't really hold it because the bezels are so small you're always touching the screen. A common issue many have reported is the touchpad which jumps all over but that's a software issue with other apps which are incompatible. I deleted a bunch and it worked but dunno which was the culprit.If you are buying this because you hope to use other Samsung devices with this seamlessly, well, my galaxy buds don't always pair with this and there is no interface which I was surprised by. In fact you can't use the apps for galaxy devices with this Chromebook.It doesn't recognize my Samsung phone even which my Google pixelbook does a slightly better job at. The fingerprint scanner works maybe 50 percent of the time because it doesn't pick up my fingerprints well. Battery life isn't great but it hasn't been too bad for me. It's fast and rarely have I seen it glitch. I would have returned it for sure if I was still in the US but I bought it and left the country. I bought it to replace my pixelbook wthoch I've beat up a lot but even in it's poor state I use the pixelbook 90 percent of the time.I wanted to add to this review - it's really hard to use this laptop because when you turn it into a tablet it doesn't close all the way so you're holding something a little floppy. And the edges of the screen are so small that you're constantly activating something with your finger pads. Ironically, as sensitive as these edges are when you click on something on the screen it doesn't really register the finger well and you have to press a little hard.I'm comparing this to my Chromebook Pixel and it lacks a lot.Update March 2022.The screen quality isn't that high to explain why the battery runs out so fast. The screen not closing all the way against the case in tablet mode remains a big problem in terms of usability.I can't manage to keep the pads of my hand to activate the screen when maneuvering this laptop. A zero bezel is terrible even on a phone much less a touchscreen laptop.",1
"where would you get a laptop / chromebook with  4K UHD AMOLED touch screen, core i5. 256 ssd nvme storage and a great build quality weighing 2.29 pounds / 1.07 Kg for $568-$700 ?!.  A portable Amoled 13.3 inch monitor would probably cost around $700-1000 ! .  Yes the battery life is not great - about 4.5 -5 hours -  but I would not sit  that long on a single charge anyways and if I do I would plug it in or use a portable power bank.  What surprised me was  how good Chrome OS is, using it for the first time.  I think Chrome OS should be a mainstream operating system and windows 10/11 should be for an office environment.  On Chrome OS I use microsoft office , outlook, word and Excel downloaded from chrome web store, but most of the time I use it for reading , web browsing and youtube - and this is where the 4K Amoled is great.  Netflix should have a better arrangement with  Google / Chrome OS and should stream 4K videos and not just FHD 108P.",0
" I had it for around 3 weeks, everything was good at first but after week 2 the mouse track pad became unresponsive even after restarting it many times. Same with the touch screen, it froze on me many times. (Refer to video) Apparently this is a common issue on these laptops . Also I'm sure you heard it before but the battery sucks ! I was getting 4 hours max on ""regular use"" . Its a shame because i really liked the laptop, the screen resolution its amazing and the laptop feels VERY light and premium but having those issues in just 2 weeks its unacceptable.I had to return it.",1
Keyboard bad on both.,1
"Very poor and buggy.os crashes every time the screen is off (sometimes even when the screen is on) and falls into recovery mode..,the screen panel just unstable and swinging like crazy, which makes it impossible to draw with the pen,battery life also terrible,Netflix app support only 480p resolutionthe 4k screen is just useless exept youtube,Linux is too limited and slow.very very bad purchase.Samsung messed up big time!Don't waste your money!!",1
"If you have galaxy products in your home, they are all integrated. Software optimization is still in its infancy, but it's understandable due to the Intel vs. Qualcomm rivalry. The android/linux app development is built into the OS. Future models might benefit from larger RAM sizes on the main board, but you can always partition a bit of your virtual memory as ram if things slow down. It's really designed for the people who hate having to get virtual box and android emulators.",0
No HDMI port.  I missed that when I was reviewing the specs,1
I love it !!! The size is just rite I’m happy with my order,1
"This is a very disappointing laptop. First, it doesn't connect to WI-FI. It connected when I first started it, but disconnected after I used for a few minutes it and it and never connected after that. The colors are dull, so there is no way you can watch a movie. It seems sturdy and well constructed on the outside, but the inside is useless. Returning it!",1
"This thing is so cool! Usually I try to go with the latest and greatest if I can justify the cost, but the reviews of this year’s Chromebook 2 vs last year’s Chromebook helped me make the decision to go with last year’s model. Better screen, fingerprint reader, and the fact that instead of $999 it cost less than $600 (plus some credit I already had with Amazon, so I paid less than $300 for it.) It’s starting to compete with my iPad Pro as my daily driver, since most of what I do is web based anyway.The only issue I have is with the touch screen. When I flip the screen to put it in tablet mode, the touch screen stops working until I restart it. The problem is I can’t tell if it’s a hardware problem / defective unit, or if there is an issue with the latest release of ChromeOS. Unfortunately I have asked the question in three places and have not received a response. I am hoping it’s just a glitch with the Chrome OS, because I really like this thing. I even have Crossover running Windows apps and have had no issues with lagging. It’s not getting warm at all (there is no cooling fan.) Did I mention you can run Linux apps on a Chromebook now too? I wasn’t sure about the Fiesta Red, at first I thought it would be too loud, but I’m glad I did it. Shiny and cool looking.Update to my review - the touch screen problem was fixed by Powerwashing it.",1
"I am pleased with just about everything with this laptop except the battery life. Actually, the battery life isn't as bad as I was led to think by other reviewers. So long as I dial back the screen brightness a bit I get about five hours, which isn't too bad for my usage. But not a battery life champ. In every other respect, this laptop is definitely five stars and has become my favorite.",1
I love the thin lightweight design. Screen sensitivity is very nice.,1
This is a great little laptop for on the go! It’s sturdy and strong. It’s traveled all over the place with us and never disappoints. Buying another one for myself!,1
Love this little computer. Looks brand new,1
"Now, the main concern of course is battery but it isn't as diré as reviews show it to be anymore, updates really helped it out. I was extremely hesitant at buying from this company since very few people have and it was mixed but I'm glad I took the risk. Sellers responded to me soon enough and they sent me the device without a scratch, they should have labeled it like new and not just good as condition as people would get the wrong impression. All in all, I get to write a review about a 1000 dollar device I paid 550 for and I couldn't be happier!",0

Received a used product. There were scratches on the outside and the stickers by the keyboard were peeling up on the corners. So disappointed.,1
I love this light weight easy to use Samsung Galaxy tablet. It works great for me and serves me well especially while traveling!,0
"I had very gracefully tripped over the power cable on my old Chromebook. Fortunately the only thing I broke was not my knees, but the screen on my computer. 24 hours later I had this replacement in my home set up and running.Nice little machine. Perfectly clean and functional; you'd never know it was not brand new. It was packed very professionally and shipped out immediately. Talk about caring for the customer! Wow. And the price fit my budget. I'd gladly buy from this seller again.",0
"There was no charger cord in the package with the chromebook, and the seller promptly sent me one, which was very nice. My biggest problem is that this chromebook can not connect to wifi. So unfortunately it is useless. There is nothing wrong with our Wifi. All of our other devices work. This one says there is an error configuring network and that there are no networks. So this is basically a paperweight and completely useless. I am out of options except I guess to send this piece of junk back. I expected more of a Samsung.",1
"Only had a day so far, but very impressed.Update: After about five months of daily use, my daughter continues to get excellent results from this device, for both school work and personal entertainment.  I added a solid screen protector, just in case.Zero negative comments about this device. But have decided to get a magnetic adapter for connecting the charging cable, to avoid damaging the charge-cable when removing it.",0
"Stopped charging after just 6 months. Replaced the charger, NOTHING!",1
Did not knpw it was a refurbished product,1
Great value my wife  loves browsing the Internet on it,1
"Early impressions - Impossibly thin. Android apps are surprisingly better than web app variants. Red is the laptop color I never knew I needed. The keyboard travel and ""thud"" is satisfying and the trackpad is Apple level.Like every other review, the battery is abysmal compared to any ultrabook in 2020 (3-4 hours max with comfortable brightness). However, this is the best home laptop you can get right now. The design is hard to appreciate until it's in your hands, but I have never seen a thinner device with an i5 chip. It gets warm without a fan but nothing uncomfortable. The pen performs better than the gen 1 Apple Pencil I'm coming off of. I can't say this is great for art, but you get access to Concepts in the Play store and Adobe Draw. I do wish Samsung Notes was an option given the Galaxy name, but here we are. Big, big fan of using my mobile only fantasy football app (Sleeper) on a bigger screen. Most Android apps I've installed are responsive which helps to avoid going fullscreen/forced to use the touchscreen in portrait.Connecting a Dualshock4 controller was effortless, didn't need to configure for Among Us either. Some games like Shadowfall will need some effort to work. No CoD Mobile support was a bummer, hopefully in an update.Complaints: The screen looks great, however no 4k support on most streaming options AND due to the OLED this screen is very dim by default. If you have it at 50% your eyes will be strained after an hour. 70% is comfortable, getting 4 hours average.If you're looking to continue your Android experience in laptop form, this is the way.",1
Great deal for the money. Not the most high quality screen but the value!!! Is amazing. Best purchase ever.,1
Build quality is great. The keyboard layout is very good. Responsive touch pad. Screen could have been better. I bought this for my mom. She loved the gift.,1
"I purchased two renewed versions of this chromebook. They both functioned well for 8 months, but now one has failed. It will no longer take a charge and it is past the 90 day warranty. The seller has declined to fix or replace the broken chromebook. So, I find the overall value of the product to be low.",1
I like it,1
This chromebook replaced an older model that was going to lose support.  The samsung is faster than my old chromebook but is missing a HDMI connection and a USB connection that the old Lenovo had.  By adding a USB port I solved that problem. Since my wife's tablet will cast to the TV I no longer need the HDMI port. All in all the Samsung is a upgrade,1
Awsome and cheep. The kids love them,1
"This is a beautiful little Chromebook. It is light, with a high resolution screen, and a nice keyboard. Unfortunately, it is unreliable. I got one about a month ago. Several times a day it crashed. It stopped while I was working, or when I opened the top to turn it back on, it had crashed back to the sign-on screen with a message: ""Chrome didn't shut down correctly."" It also hung up, refusing to turn on until you held the power key for 20 seconds. Also, it did not work with the wi-fi extender. A ""powerwash"" reset did not help.Amazon gave me a replacement unit with no argument. It arrived yesterday. Yesterday it crashed once, and hung up once. Today it crashed again. Modern computer equipment is reliable so this is unusual. I do not think it is a coincidence that two out of two are unreliable.In my opinion, the designers put too much effort into strange features such as the stylus, and a non-working fingerprint detection key. (I finally got it to register after several attempts, but it does not sign on to anything.) They should have made it more reliable instead.I will probably keep it, because a Chromebook is more of a glorified i-Pad more than it is a computer. As long as you can browse, it is okay, even if it crashes unexpectedly. It has various applications such as word processing, but they are all the Google on-line versions, so you do not lose your work when it crashes. I will keep this one, but I would not recommend it to anyone.I recommend Chromebooks in general. For my purposes they are much better than laptop computers. I had another one for many years, from another maker. It never had problems like this. It finally died of old age, but it was reliable for a long time.FOLLOW UP: The replacement unit crashed 5 times in one day, so I returned it for a refund. Again, Amazon did not give me any trouble. They suggested I contact Samsung and tell them I had problems with two units. The woman at Samsung said, ""we have not heard of any problems like that."" I told her to come here to Amazon and read these reviews. I have a feeling that someone in their organization is not letting the bad news about this product spread through the company.",0
I love the thin lightweight design. Screen sensitivity is very nice.,0
I guess you can order a good-as-new laptop for ninety bucks. What a time to be alive,1

"A surprisingly powerful machine in a tight little package. I've never seen a thinner screen on anything. The chrome OS makes the 8Gb of RAM and i5 core processor seem like overkill for what I use it for which is primarily viewing streaming video and some gaming. I could do with a little more battery life, a better way to vent the heat and more solid feet on the bottom and louder internal speakers. But again where this machine excels is the screen, it's bright, crisp and doesn't have excessively large bezels the addition of the S-pen makes this machine extremely versatile.",0
"TL;DR great computer with cool features but compromised battery for thinness. The first thing I have to say is that the screen quality is superb and paired with tablet mode is a defiant win in my book. The s pen is muchmore functional on a Note 20 ultra than a computer, it is a cool gimmick and makes presentations easier because of the red dot feature. The i5 is a medium stage processor, I was going to buy a dell with an i7 but decided that the i5 was good enough, the thinness is also extremely convenient having a decent computer without added weight. There are a few cons though, the battery life is comparable to the note 20 ultra running full boar. This computer also only runs chrome which can be a downside to some but not to me. The c charger on both sides is one of the best parts of this computer because now I only need the fast charger it came with to charge my phone, computer, or headphones. The lighted keyboard makes a big difference in the dark and the camera near the keyboard made to take photos in tablet mode is cool because it looks like a big note 20. It also says on streaming services that it is running 8k but the screen is only capable of 4k. Overall this is a good student computer and worth the money, but if you need the windows just buy the new galaxy book pro. 6.9inch note 20 ultra for scale, 1:1 scale on both s pens. Viewing screen size is the same as the note 20 ultra, about 1.5 the size of an s8+ of note 20 ultra thickness wise. This thing is phone thin. Samsung has yet to fail me.",1

So far so good. Easy set-up. Not too much verification to walk thru. Nice and light. Easy hook-up of a port with the wireless mouse device. It will take some time for me to get used to the programming as I've only lived in a Windows world. One thing I have to get used to is all the banner & pop-up ads. Another thing to be careful of is the type of cover if you want one. I'm opting for a bag as I had to return the cover because it didn't fit.,0
"once i found out how to do it it synced all my old Chromebook info to new, very happy with product",1
Love it,1
"if you want an inexpensive chromebook, do not hesitate to buy this.  for me, this is exactly what i wanted and does everything that i need it to. battery life has blown me away.  no complaints whatsoever.i would certainly recommend this.",1
"Its sad my daughter bought this with her first check this year.... it worked well for awhile then all of sudden it doesnt charge anymore.  I contacted Amazon it was a 90 day warranty.  I was told to contact the seller, there is no contact information.  She only had it for six months now, its sad Amazon will not help her and the company make sure you will not be able to contact them if anything goes wrong.  Bad Customer Service!",1
"Despite the valid short battery life reports, I bought the Samsung as it was being discounted before new models were introduced, and very pleased with the speed and especially the jaw-dropping screen, and now it's dropped another hundred bucks - what a steal !  I'd read other raves about the 4K AMOLED screen (made by Samsung), but seeing was almost not believing.  Colors are so deep, so brilliant, and when you switch a YouTube video from regular high def to 4K resolution, it becomes crystal clear - best way to describe it is that it appears I'm looking at a real image through glass.  Specs for the 13.3 inch screen are 3840 X 2160 pixels, which some think is overkill but I disagree because of the pure viewing pleasure it provides.  The rest of the hardware is super fast and a quality build.  If you buy a newer version of this, just make sure it's got the 3840 x 2160 screen !",0
Got it fast and my son loves it very nice and well kept 👌 set up was easy and fast thank you,1
"This is my 5th Chromebook purchase. Once it arrived, I was able to update to most current OS version within 30 minutes. With so many companies switching to Software as a Service (SaaS), this Chromebook works perfectly (for me). I’m having no problem accessing Clover Dashboard, Mailchimp, Hootsuite, Office 365 and more. The screen resolution prevents me from recommending for extended use, but it is great for field trips and outside office activities. USB-C power supply is a huge plus. Needing a HDMI to USB-C video adapter to connect to an external monitor is a minor inconvenience.",1
This was not a good product. Absolutely trash power. It says 4 gb of ram but it runs like half a gig.,1
"I’ve never purchased a chrome book before but I’m so thrilled that I did. This is perfect for my needs of using the internet, writing stories, keeping in contact with friends and family and for the price it’s such an incredible purchase.",0
Ok not all that good,1
Office work.,1
"where would you get a laptop / chromebook with  4K UHD AMOLED touch screen, core i5. 256 ssd nvme storage and a great build quality weighing 2.29 pounds / 1.07 Kg for $568-$700 ?!.  A portable Amoled 13.3 inch monitor would probably cost around $700-1000 ! .  Yes the battery life is not great - about 4.5 -5 hours -  but I would not sit  that long on a single charge anyways and if I do I would plug it in or use a portable power bank.

Traveling convenient!,1
"I needed a new Chromebook and after searching Amazon I decided on this refurbished Samsung based on price and delivery, (next day). As it turns out, it was a good decision. The unit as delivered to me is essentially flawless. Not a blemish or scratch, in like new condition. Set up was surprisingly easy, and it picked up all my old Chromebook settings automatically from Google.Taking a chance on a refurbished product from Amazon was iffy, but being a long time Amazon customer, I knew if there was a problem it would be corrected easily. Overall I'm completely satisfied.The one con I have is that I would like the display to be a little crisper, but the quality is good enough not to be a deal breaker.For the overall quality, price and delivery I'm very satisfied.",1
Great bought one for me and one for my wife.,1
very good,1
Beautiful piese of art and use it for leisure. I heard a lot about battery life but it's just fine for me. I wouldn't exchange it for the 4k screen which I always ust it for the brightest. Compare it with my galaxy S6 which I like it a lot but it can't beat 4k screen.,0
"This is my first Samsung computer not counting that fact I have the fold 2 which one open is a tablet not to mention a Samsung tablet from a t t now about the computer it's Chrome OS it has 256gb of storage and I-5 a quarter screen a beautiful red color case Nokia keyboard a signal Penske scanner touch very thin and lightweight now the bad. Speakers suck has no fans so the witches glass which I wish constantly wouldn't fail fails but you can use a Bluetooth mouse now the ports are near the new Mini type c ports so I had to buy a converter so I can hook up my stand that has built-in fan to keep it cool I said I had to hook up my Bluetooth speaker what she said since my Samsung phone and my three-year-old Samsung tablet have amazing speakers from Samsung and it's originally 2 years ago went for over $1,000 I didn't pay nearly that much does get very hot Alvin that what I recommended well if you don't mind knowing that you've already wasted two years of updates and you only get six more years even though less powerful new Samsung phone book I have no 4K screen do I forgot to mention that the best part of this computer is a 4K screen put on a 13in screen can sometimes tell is 4K so if you really want a 4K Chromebook and I don't want the one bus Google which is going to soon be unsupported and you don't mind not relying on the trackpad which is beautifully designed knowing they were crap out constantly and that it overheats Cuts Lena the speakers suck I say go for it I know what you're getting into guess it should have been the Escalade Chromebooks like Google's pixel would have been the Cadillac and I'm pretty sure for the price that cost nowadays you can get much better but other brand but I have always wanted to Samsung computer on our I'm 95% happy with my purchase other than the trackpad malfunction case with overheating and speakers that's why I took five points off hope was helpful also a little bit about my background besides the phone and the tablet I told you about and this Chromebook I also have a Surface Pro 7 Shawn fairly knowledgeable about computers",1
Good value,1
"Bought for my kids homeschooling , works great doesn’t lag haven’t had any problems and it’s almost Christmas already and my 13yo didn’t break it yet so it must be decent 👍",1
This is a premium quality chrome book for the price. My only complaint is that the battery life is a little low.,1
"Haven't used only tested it, been in case",1
It's a cool little Chromebook  I was skeptical at 1st to get it after reading the reviews because they said the battery life and the functionality between apps and Microsoft to stuff like that and that  It got hot really quick but that has not been the case for me it is the case if you leave it flat on a surface and don't let the fans have time to blow the air going down part about it is it doesn't have regular USB slot so I had to get a connection to plugging a side mouse for it ask for it other than that the laptop's good it's really really quick and all the functionality on it's pretty cool,1
"A good place to start would be that I got this chromebook at a discount ($749, down from $999). And my needs are mainly to run Citrix (through browser or Chrome app, either works) for work and to casually browse, read magazines/books or listen to Spotify.  Not a ""Power User"" by any means, though not sure any Chrome OS user is.That being said, this is THE BEST CHROMEBOOK I'VE EVER USED, and it is more than perfect to suit my needs.Build: The thing is beautiful, a really premium feel to the materials, and the red is really classy and not too gaudy as I was a bit worried and almost went with the more drab grey option - I'm glad I didn't. The chrome ring around the outside is also a premium touch that looks great. It's the thinnest and lightest 2-in-1 laptop I've ever seen, and I know that I like to use 2-in-1s in tablet mode and this is the first time it actually feels comfortable and feasible to do that for more than a brief period of time. The 2.2lbs was a big draw for me when comparing this laptop to the Galaxy Chromebook 2, Asus C436, or the Acer Spin 713 - upon using it I am glad I took it into consideration. Other great things about the build are the relatively loud stereo speakers and the built-in stylus. Minor drawbacks would be the weak hinge that doesn't always hold the screen in place when moving the laptop if open (though for the most part it does the job) and the lack of ports (you just get 2 USB-C ports, which also function as charging ports, so if you're charging you only have 1...adapters easily solve this). Also the cameras are weak but I don't use those - if you're buying for camera quality only for some reason (Zoom?) then this isn't the one for you.Screen: The SCREEN is AMAZING. The OLED is top notch and better than any Chromebook I've ever seen, at full brightness the colors are insane. That being said, the high resolution and the brightness eat at the battery life a lot, so in most cases I've got brightness scaled way down and I don't really miss anything, it works fine. Touch works perfectly, the stylus allows for really detailed notes/drawings in Canva or other apps. One drawback might be the bezel placement, there are 3 super-thin outer bezels and one larger bottom bezel... in tablet mode that one larger bezel functions well as a ""handle"" of sorts, but the other sides can't be touched without accidentally hitting the screen and scrolling or clicking a link, etc. A very minor nuisance at most. Another minor issue is that the resolution is SO GOOD that when I run Citrix, the session almost appears blurry, but still workable - on high resolution windows machines Citrix has addressed this with DPI scaling, but they've yet to master this on the Chrome OS app or the Chrome web app. Not Samsung's issue, but still part of my experience with the machine so I thought it worth mentioning.Performance: This thing is a BEAST. There's arguably no need for an Intel i5 in a Chromebook, but here we are, and the thing is FAST. Scrolling is smooth and even with tons of tabs open I've never experienced lag when playing videos or games. With lots going on under the hood, and no fan, I've heard mention from others that the computer can get really hot under heavy loads - I've barely experienced this while using a decent amount of processing power, and would elaborate that when I did feel heat it was very minor and not unbearable by any means. I'm thinking unless you are gaming a lot or developing in linux or doing something really really processor heavy, you'll be fine. A small performance gripe in general is that Android apps don't always play well with Chrome OS and have re-sizing issues or some lag, but this is not a Samsung problem, more of a Google problem.Battery Life: Some people have called this the achilles heel of the laptop, but I don't have much issue. Again, I'm not a real gamer/developer/super user - I am Joe Basic using it for administrative work and browsing/music/reading. On an average day at like 70% brightness I can unplug at 8am and make it to about 3 or 4pm before having to plug back in while working in Citrix doing basic tasks on MS Access, Excel, etc - nothing intense but that's pretty much constant screentime for about 6-7 hours before it starts getting low and I've got to plug in. Obviously this is not great in comparison to 10+ hours at full brightness seen on other Chromebooks - but you are getting more than the average Chromebook here and this is a bit of a concession made on Samsung's part to provide the rest of the goods. Overall if you don't need to be away from a charger for more than 6 hours every day, you shouldn't have an issue.Should you buy it: If you have read this far and think your needs/usage are similar to mine and you want the sleek-est, coolest, thinnest chromebook out there, DEFINITELY BUY THIS (especially if on discount, which it frequently is between Amazon, Best Buy, and Samdsung's own site).",0
I've had a few chromeboooks and this is the best and high-quality one. I have not had the battery problems people mentioned - getting around six hours of basic surfing and watching movies; maybe Samsung/Google made some software updates to alleviate the problem.  I really love it. I think it is the best chromebook on the market ... still.,0

Battery life,1
"Excellent quality, and works perfectly for a student in High school.",1
"Honestly this Is the best laptop Ive ever owned, the OLED screen is just gorgeous, also this computer is just 0.4 inch thin, just like the Acer Swift 7, the processor is very snappy, transfers files greatly due to its solid technology SSD. Chrome OS has a great user experience and I've replaces Microsoft with Google Docs. A great thing is the trackpad gestures and being able to create virtual desktops. Also Chrome OS has great connectivity, I am running a logitech BRIO webcam, my MX Keys, mouse and I am about to but a trackpad from apple. Battery runa for five hours and I don't care",1
Does not even turn on.,1
"Computer is in excellent condition, just as advertised",1
"Despite the valid short battery life reports, I bought the Samsung as it was being discounted before new models were introduced, and very pleased with the speed and especially the jaw-dropping screen, and now it's dropped another hundred bucks - what a steal !  I'd read other raves about the 4K AMOLED screen (made by Samsung), but seeing was almost not believing.  Colors are so deep, so brilliant, and when you switch a YouTube video from regular high def to 4K resolution, it becomes crystal clear - best way to describe it is that it appears I'm looking at a real image through glass.  Specs for the 13.3 inch screen are 3840 X 2160 pixels, which some think is overkill but I disagree because of the pure viewing pleasure it provides.  The rest of the hardware is super fast and a quality build.  If you buy a newer version of this, just make sure it's got the 3840 x 2160 screen !",1
"I have zero issues. Works perfect. Fast and reliable. Easy to use and you can easily transfer your google account apps, info, contacts, internet history, games, in less than 10 minutes. I recommend.",1
Beautiful piese of art and use it for leisure. I heard a lot about battery life but it's just fine for me. I wouldn't exchange it for the 4k screen which I always ust it for the brightest. Compare it with my galaxy S6 which I like it a lot but it can't beat 4k screen.,1
I like everything,0
"First of all let's start with the design which is unbelievable. Being able to come up with such a powerful device so thin and light, just sets the bar on what is possible.Nevertheless it is still a Chromebook/Android tablet/2 in 1. Superfast on everything web-related, secure, beautiful screen and Android apps support make it ideal for most use cases if not a bit of an overkill.But if one needs tasks like video/photo editing, desktop Office apps etc, other solutions may be more suitable for the price.",1
Simple yet very versatile!,1
"I needed a new Chromebook and after searching Amazon I decided on this refurbished Samsung based on price and delivery, (next day). As it turns out, it was a good decision. The unit as delivered to me is essentially flawless. Not a blemish or scratch, in like new condition. Set up was surprisingly easy, and it picked up all my old Chromebook settings automatically from Google.Taking a chance on a refurbished product from Amazon was iffy, but being a long time Amazon customer, I knew if there was a problem it would be corrected easily. Overall I'm completely satisfied.The one con I have is that I would like the display to be a little crisper, but the quality is good enough not to be a deal breaker.For the overall quality, price and delivery I'm very satisfied.",1
"Honestly the battery gets a bad reputation but it isn’t as bad as it’s portrayed. Yes it is short you only get 4-6 hours or so with full brightness. After a couple weeks you get in the habit of charging it when your not using it. Once you get used to keeping it charged it lasts all night or all day no problem. The best laptop I have had personally. Screen has great quality, the color is amazing, loads extremely fast and does very well with having multiple tabs open at once. A solid 9.5 out of 10 for me. 1 con I found is overtime the mousepad is easily subject to damage if not cared for properly. With everyday use it’s no problem but not very durable with drops.",1
"I’ve never purchased a chrome book before but I’m so thrilled that I did. This is perfect for my needs of using the internet, writing stories, keeping in contact with friends and family and for the price it’s such an incredible purchase.",1
This is one of the best items I have ever purchased from Amazon. This Chromebook was basically new without one single scratch or blemish. The price was fair I am very glad I pulled the trigger and will recommend this seller to my huge network. Thank you!,1
"When I first received the laptop I was unable to login because the laptop hadn't been factory reset but, after contacting technical support I was able resolve the problem easily. I'm still finding out how to navigate my laptop but, so far my laptop has exceeded my expectations 😊",1
My daughter loves this computer!,1
"The Chromebook that I received was in such good condition it was almost brand new. There was no scratches, screen was clean. Easy to set up. No bumps in the road. I bought it for writing and doing small bits and pieces of editing and it has really worked out well. Another reason I bought this is because I looove going to coffee shops to read and such. Now I can go get coffee and write too! It's a really nice computer that seems to be up to date and will stay that way for awhile. :)",0
"I got the white screen saying that ""Chrome OS is missing or damaged."" I tried installing chrome again. I restarted it. I called Samsung support and was on the phone for over two hours just for them to tell me that I'll have to send it in. I sent it the next day ($18 just to ship it), and they told me today that it was broken and they would have to send me a replacement. Fingers crossed that it goes well and they'll keep their word.The computer itself is very nice, but the software is buggy. I don't like Apple products but now I'm considering switching over. :(",1
So far been a great purchase  love the features have not had one problem after a month  of daily use we recommend,1
"I regret purchasing this laptop on the promise that Samsung was working with Google regarding the power issue.  Samsung seems caught off guard with the battery life being only 4 hours with very consrvitive power usage.I have been looking around for an improved battery to replace the one that came inside my Samsun Galaxy Chromebook but doesn't seem to be anything new out there.  Unfortunately I have a laptop that can only be used around 4 hours on battery.This said I have been watching videos on Youtube where owners claim they get 6-8 hours of battery with brightness to 80+ percent, do i have a  bad battery or they happen to have a better release?Everything else about this Chromebook seems fine, however, my 8gb isn't that as I look to see the ram it uses 7.65Gb, this is Chromebook thing because traditionally you would have much more available for programs you have yet to opena nd run?  Less than 1 Gb available for whatever lolFinding programs in the app store that is full screen or landscape is difficult and have found some that do do not run well at all... the Galaxy Chromebook is concidered a very powerful machine, but seems to struggle at almost anything I load into it except games.  I did load a simple game but failed to keep running and crashes constantly.Perhaps I am asking too much from this Chromebook, I do not do much, mostly edit my website, write small blogs, spreadsheets, email and videos on YT and movies I've purchased.  That pretty much it!I don't recommend this model.Before all of this, I tried to order the original Pixelbook but Amazon accidentally sent me a high end Pixelbook Go (Not PInk), and being the honest person I am returned it and then ended up ordering the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook instead.",1
"Wafer-thin and packed with Chromebook features, the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2020 (Galaxy from now on) is a beauty. In Fiesta Red, the Galaxy catches eyes and the form build looks like a colorful piece of thick cardboard.  Currently, Amazon is selling this for $799.99 ($200 less than I purchased the unit a week ago.) I work with Windoze and Mac professionally but at home, I enjoy using several Samsung tablets, the Chromebook Pro and other quality products from the company.I was really on the fence as I have a Samsung Pro from 2 years back and it does all that I need, Yet the lure of a better screen and CPU chip finally enticed me. I also welcome the Bluetooth 5 for earbuds and the lightness of the overall unit.As others have mentioned, the battery life when using the quality screen settings are a little below four hours, weak compared to the Asus Flip, with almost better specs- but the Flip doesn't have the quality screen this unit does. (I'm not carrying a charger with me when a battery pack will do the job.)The added functionality of Android apps, which are not always available with other brands, make this Galaxy a winner. Besides, I am a Samsung fan. At $800. this is a worthy contender to Best Chromebook of 2020.",1

"We can’t get it to connect to our Wi-Fi at all, so waste of money for us!",1
I use Apple products and Samsung and Google So well made just like my Ipad Pro Google Pixel book and Samsung S7 plus this Samsung Chromebook has the best display ok speakers 4k on YouTube wow,1
Overall this laptop is a good investment. Easy to set up. A bit small but great quality product.,0
"The equiptment arrived as posted,nicely packaged. As,of this date7/25 the chromebook is doing it's thing without any glitches. I have no problems to date so,I can't comment on the seller but I am sure they will handle any problems that I might have.",0
"* The left arrow key doesn't reliably connect unless I hit it much harder than I have to hit the other keys.* It's a roll of the dice whether the laptop shuts off or merely sleeps when I close the lid, which means when I re-open it I'm often faced with a full restart, and Chrome has to re-load all my tabs etc. This seems to reset brightness preferences: the screen starts up intolerably dim, for some reason.* Even worse, occasionally when I re-open the laptop it's in this weird state where it seems to think it's on, but the screen is completely black and I have to force a restart. This is both annoying and concerning.* The keyboard is technically backlit, but the light is so dim that it barely helps even when it's dark.* The trackpad is easily pushed down to click near its bottom, but gets increasingly difficult as you go up, which just feels really weird and inconsistent. More than 1/2 of the way up, it's too hard to press for me to practically want to.Despite all the flaws, I love this machine. It's super light. I like the feel of the construction. I like the color. I really like having the browser back/forward/refresh on the keyboard. The stylus, working with Android art programs I already knew and loved, has been a delight. It's really nice to be able to go right from typing an article to drawing illustrations for it on the same device. Being able to run android apps natively on a 2-in-1 is really cool (even though realistically I'd often be better off using the desktop versions of apps on a mac or windows machine -- for example, Slack and Discord do not provide a great experience running their android app in chromos, compared with the experience of their desktop applications on mac. And in other cases, like Webtoons, I'm realistically better off just visiting the webpage. But running the app natively is so cool!).",0
Just Right!,1
