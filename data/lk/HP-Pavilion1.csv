"The laptop is awesome. Smooth browsing and no lags. Haven't tested the gaming yet. But there is instant power dissipation. But when you switch to 60 hz from 144 hz, the power consumption gets reduced and it gives the battery backup of around 3 hrs on normal usage. Otherwise if you continue in 144 hz, power consumption is more. That's the only cons in it, the rest is awesome. The display, processor, graphics and all.READ MORE",1
