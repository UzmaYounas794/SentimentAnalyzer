"That's not to say VIVO phones aren't good quality; they really are ‚Äì especially if you go for its flagship and mid-range options. From around 2018 onwards, VIVO's quality control and finesse improved dramatically. It now makes some of the most durable and reliable phones on the market at this price point.READ MORE",1

"Back camera is appreciable. Front camera is not that good. But at this price range, it is fine.The noteworthy feature is smoothness in gaming. The ultra game mode is good.Battery lasts for a day on moderate usage.Screen refreshment rate is good.Gamers should consider buying it.In 5g, it has just 2 bands, which is fine as we don't know when it will be implemented all across India and even if it comes, it will function ok.READ MORE",1

As usal phone looks premium with study built quality* Camera performance is average not up-to mark.* Comes with latest android 12 and funtouch os 12.* So battery optimization is good enough* As it's price range it supports only 18w fast charging.* More over it is value for money when you buy with exchange or on card offer.READ MORE,1

"Don't buy vivo t1 5g wastage of money camera very poor,lags many times google phone is one of the worst think of this phone in low light camera performance is very poor,READ MORE",0
"No prvision for dedicated memory slot. Vivo can only replace with same phone. Waste of money. If you are making changes, those should be highlighted. Vivo is scared of selling existing inventory due to ED raids. Be careful with Vivo phones. I used to be fan of Vivo phones. Now please don't buy.READ MORE",0

I don't advise you to go for it, it was my great mistake.to choose Vivo produc. Worst product. Now one more issue found with this product is that the Bluetooth mic is not working especially while the incoming call I replaced my bluetooth boat device but the issue was the sameREAD MORE",0
