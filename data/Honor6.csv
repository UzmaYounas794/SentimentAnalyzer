its been 2 weeks using this phone.pros:1. First thing what captures your attention is the brilliant notch display.its amazing.2. Processor justifies the phone with good software optimisation.3. Camera is brilliant in day light but could have been better artificial light however with flash it balances the low light.this you can expect in this price range.4.

"Amazing as always.. This my 3rd Honor phone..  N believe me this one is also doesn't Disappoint in anything..

Ordered Honor 9N from flipkart in egg blue color. was delivered within the promised time. the phone looks amazing. I am a moderate user and the battery at the end of 24 hours was still 24%. photos are good though the colors are slightly more saturated. But this is easily corrected by slight change in settings. the display and over all feel of the phone is good. Highly satisfied as of now. Will recommend this to anyone looking to buy a phone in this range.READ MORE,1

"Look wise just WOW, not for heavy gamer, good for camera and selfi lovers, Updated processor would be better (for fast charging and dual 4g support).And battery wont last full day on heavy usage, so you have to charge twice a day, which take 2.5 hrs to charge.

The phone looks good so far and it‚Äôs pretty lite. The battery backup is good and there is no lag so far. The display is pretty bright even in direct sunlight. I am not huge fan of Face ID but it does a decent job. Finger print sensor is excellent as expected from Honor. Sound is decent from both speaker as well as from headphone. I haven‚Äôt used the camera extensively so not sure about the quality of pictures and videos yet.READ MORE,1

"Hey Guys, Please don't buy this phone as i have got the faulty phone with touch problem. Automatically the touch is happening on the screen. I have launched the replacement request and one Engineer (from Jeeves) visited. He just viewed my phone for a minute and went. After sometime I got to know that Flipkart has rejected my replacement request . Totally unsatisfied with Flipkart & Honor as well. Wasted my 14000 Hard Earned Money.READ MORE",0

Loss of valuable money. Plz do not go for this product. Looks wise it's no. 1 but battery life is pathetic. After using it for 2 months now I have to charge it not less than thrice a day. And still the battery finishes in just 4 hours of use. Flipkart is not helping. I thought of exchanging it with some other model but Honor 9n is not on the exchange list. IMEI is not valid. I am hopeless.READ MORE,0

Honor 9N is not an exception..The selfie camera is awesome.. with some built in touch ups , it is a boon to those who loves to look nice in selfies. The build quality is superb. The glass body design will be unpleasant to some users..But it looks stunningly luxurious. In short hundred times worth the money you pay.. kudos to huawei and thanks to flipkartREAD MORE",1
