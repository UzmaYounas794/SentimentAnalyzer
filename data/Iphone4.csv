"iPhone 11 is a good phone. Not a very big difference between 12 except for the OLED screen and a very minor camera improvement which is you cant make a difference. If you are planning for a iPhone and you have budget you definitely can go for this without second thoughts. Now some people are complaining and giving review 0 or so because there is no charger and headphones, but thats been already mentioned so I assume they are illiterate. Its not that Flipkart is removing them duh. Anyways bee...READ MORE",1

Very very good excellent thank you for FlipkartREAD MORE,1
Phone looks so premium in hands the purple variant is so solid in colour. Camera performance is good and the mobile performance is excellent. Battery is okay for the average user but a person who uses more needs to charge twice a day daily. Ram management and storage management is good. Display is ips lcd without any refresh rate so that‚Äôs could be a cheaper side in terms of display for investing more than 40k on mobile. The phone is overall good and worth the price.READ MORE,1

Overall I am happy with the Apple iPhone 11. For past four years I used one plus 3T and personally I loved the phone and have no complaints so far. I thought of initially upgrading to the latest OnePlus phone but seeing the negative remarks/opinions I changed my mind and went for iPhone and eventually felt it was a good decision.  It will take some time to adjust to iPhone if you are an android user but truly you will love it after some time.Camera and performance of  iPhone is superb.READ MORE,1
This is my first ever I phone. Before this I was using my google nexus 5. But moving from android to iOS is a great experience. It‚Äôs worth at this price.

Best in class. Battery backup is good especially when you play games like Pubg COD. But it is sort of heavy when you hold in hands. Portrait mode is best to click pictures.
