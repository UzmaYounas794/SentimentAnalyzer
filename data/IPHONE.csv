"1) Awesome Display - Yes i had done lot of research and people out there were saying about it pixel density, but in reality when you hold this side by side to any phone you will be surprised how good the phone actually is. 2) Speed - It is just super duper speed, you will be surprised to see that it handles 30-40 apps without tiny lag3) Camera - Though it has single lens, it is far better than those andriods having 48MP's. 4) Battery -  This is big advantage of buying this phone as it has ...READ MORE",1

"Amazing phone with a very powerful battery. Its the most practical iPhone. Though it has a LCD display it still feels premium n feels the best. It's the best choice if being upgraded from iPhone 7 or 8 or any lower iPhone models. Nothing to think of it its the best in the range, the camera, the built, the battery are really powerful.. A worthy purchaseREAD MORE",1
"I feel as if the people who gave the iPhone XR low ratings either didn't know what they were getting or didn't do research. I did a lot of research about the XR by watching a lot of Youtube videos of what the XR had to offer and the changes made from the previous iPhone models. The first thing is that the XR doesn't have a Finger Print Home Button, instead it uses Face Recognition to unlock it or a Pin Code. Second thing is that the Control Center has moved from swiping up from the bottom to ...READ MORE",1

"One of the best(so called budget) iphone ever... Awsome build quality. Every one complaining about the screen, yes it's an lcd display with HD resolution but it's not that bad, it's a good display very bright & colour accurate. The camera of this phone is just awsome, sound quality is very good(thanks to the stereo speakers) & performance is too good A12 bionic is dazzling fast. Only disadvantage's are, no portrait mode for object's & the bazels are thicker than it's bigger brother. Overall I...READ MORE",1

"If you're considering iPhone XR in 2021, I think it is still a good choice and definitely a better buy than the SE which looks a decade old. Let's break down its various aspects-DISPLAY:Your screen is something that you constantly look at. I won't say it is the best screen out there in this price range because it's an LCD panel instead of an OLED with a pretty low resolution. But are you going to notice it in daily use? No, unless you're pixel peeping or use to high quality QHD+ OLED pane...READ MORE",1
